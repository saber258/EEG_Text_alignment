in terms of examining the people and making sure that the right people,0.941,0.079,-0.005,-0.112,1.388,0.333,1.661,0.669,-1.371,-1.298,-1.384,-1.21,-0.424,-0.311,0.469,-1.828,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
yeah so that's kind of Baseline,-1.612,-1.373,-1.478,-1.343,-0.706,-1.107,-2.554,-1.786,-1.31,-1.066,-1.078,-0.602,-0.247,-0.437,-0.611,-1.024,3,2,2,2,2,1,3,3,2,1,3,1
you know this behavior of,-1.378,-0.783,-1.412,-1.186,-0.453,-0.99,-1.846,-1.58,-1.218,-0.969,-1.258,-1.099,0.773,0.203,0.102,-1.291,3,2,2,2,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
but for the yemenis I think it's possible that Korean citizens can view them as Outsiders,-1.271,-1.065,-1.063,-1.23,0.542,0.736,-0.274,-1.636,-1.421,-1.424,-1.374,-1.369,-0.656,-0.804,-1.921,-1.981,3,3,1,1,2,1,4,4,2,1,1,1
they're not allowing allowing it so it's basically going against what they originally,-1.15,-1.655,-1.153,-1.146,0.328,-0.214,-2.746,-1.682,-0.635,-0.002,-0.451,-0.59,0.107,0.383,1.465,-1.293,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,1,1
mentioned that a lot of Korean citizens are against it and as a,-0.366,-0.747,-0.558,-0.318,-0.162,-0.523,2.489,0.526,-1.275,-1.22,-1.385,-1.297,-0.749,-0.841,-1.147,-1.628,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
the painting is that not accepting all these refugees,-1.503,-0.88,-1.5,-1.326,-0.659,-0.872,-2.201,-1.155,-1.285,-1.556,-1.511,-1.334,-0.84,-0.998,-0.714,-1.854,2,2,1,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,3,1
but you have to look and take care your place and also it was like,-0.989,-0.696,-1.006,-1.156,1.525,1.378,-1.287,-0.485,-1.261,-1.456,-1.296,-1.223,0.711,0.024,0.132,-1.552,4,3,1,1,2,1,4,4,2,1,2,1
should go back but I'm not sure whether they will try to stake in Korea even further because,-1.616,-1.579,-1.418,-1.251,-0.457,-0.762,-1.766,-1.887,-1.247,-1.324,-1.282,-1.117,0.395,-0.57,-1.14,-1.074,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
Fist and then look off balance so that's my first point and,-0.961,-1.198,-1.134,-1.142,0.395,-0.136,-0.265,-0.629,-1.457,-1.289,-1.424,-1.294,0.049,-0.254,-2.025,-1.707,2,3,2,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
people actually feel feel about the number is not small because Korea is,-1.676,-1.55,-1.57,-1.417,-0.604,-1.097,-2.875,-2.035,-1.213,-1.023,-1.456,-1.192,-0.5,-0.639,-0.563,-1.394,3,3,2,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,2
the judge island is a special case because once the refugees moving to the judge Island their economic activities,-1.03,-0.533,-1.23,-1.154,0.452,-0.152,0.941,-1.319,-1.024,-0.282,-0.881,-0.4,0.773,0.741,0.132,1.065,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
they there are language problems and,-1.608,-1.262,-1.478,-1.384,-0.746,-0.987,-2.112,-1.758,-1.329,-1.112,-0.99,-1.127,-0.004,-0.603,-0.958,-1.704,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,1,2,1
as you know is no also Diet also that,-1.656,-1.588,-1.632,-1.444,-1.101,-1.264,-2.751,-1.992,-1.112,-0.545,-1.159,-0.944,3.05,-1.089,-0.867,-1.029,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,1,3,1

how every other that's not really TRUE because unless you're actually a Korean citizen not,-1.444,-1.437,-1.509,-1.31,-0.311,-0.843,-1.4,-1.559,-1.565,-1.509,-1.387,-1.071,-0.214,-0.286,-2.436,-1.791,4,4,3,1,1,1,3,4,2,1,1,1
they take care of these people who they have all these different humanitarian AIDS if you were,-1.501,-1.255,-1.399,-1.329,0.302,-0.309,-0.387,-1.795,-1.349,-0.91,-1.289,-0.911,0.596,-0.241,0.008,-1.465,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,4,3,1,1,1

maybe 500 people so I would say in the last spoke about,-1.336,-0.956,-1.368,-1.332,0.348,-0.162,-0.82,-1.783,-1.585,-1.459,-1.394,-1.381,-0.218,-0.907,-2.306,-1.89,3,4,2,2,2,1,3,2,2,1,1,1
or a threat to the u.s. to the European Union so I believe that,-1.545,-1.495,-1.487,-1.395,-0.883,-0.919,-1.439,-1.817,-0.495,-0.364,-0.496,-0.572,2.923,2.065,-0.454,-0.239,4,3,1,1,3,1,3,2,1,1,2,1
but you,-1.239,-0.854,-1.229,-1.355,1.243,0.069,0.953,-0.868,-1.069,-0.422,-0.949,-1.163,0.566,1.123,0.235,-1.156,3,3,3,2,2,2,3,3,3,2,1,2
convention this is this is especially important since South Korea,-1.252,-1.102,-1.356,-1.282,0.392,-0.12,-0.752,-1.228,-0.032,0.075,-0.219,-0.81,2.349,8.598,0.722,0.278,4,3,1,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
if you are a nice if our country was a stable,-1.27,-1.093,-1.293,-1.339,1.751,1.847,-0.446,-1.617,-1.315,-1.46,-1.445,-1.303,0.325,-0.362,-2.434,-1.654,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
the Korean government should accept this group of refugees,-1.584,-1.14,-1.351,-1.368,-0.488,-0.682,-1.713,-1.819,-1.249,-1.254,-1.023,-1.095,0.161,0.277,0.046,-1.698,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,4,2,1,2,1
they do they can't and other,-1.463,-1.355,-1.163,-1.057,-0.207,-0.582,-2.643,-1.087,-1.267,-1.07,-1.17,-1.163,0.674,-0.308,-0.516,-1.251,3,4,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
so to mention about the safety,-1.491,-1.45,-1.44,-1.255,-0.393,-0.837,-1.531,-1.56,-1.467,-1.337,-1.568,-1.299,-0.876,-0.984,-2.125,-1.543,2,3,2,2,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
and the proportions are amazing how,-1.503,-1.558,-1.294,-1.256,0.344,0.738,-1.386,-1.797,-0.928,-0.98,-1.287,-1.194,0.505,-0.243,0.271,-1.128,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
bottom there are there are a lot of people who doesn't have enough money and they struggle to live out their everyday,-0.9,-0.115,-1.093,-1.162,3.066,0.894,1.2,-0.736,-1.643,-1.502,-1.552,-1.389,-0.801,-1.094,-1.956,-1.754,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
ago and we promise to the international society that we are going,-0.811,-0.366,-0.59,-0.178,-0.008,-0.262,1.89,-0.753,-0.641,-0.44,-1.086,-1.068,1.738,1.113,0.853,-0.436,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
it's not good to generalize this people in,-1.437,-1.327,-1.557,-1.275,-0.996,-1.073,-1.745,-1.667,-1.479,-1.276,-1.473,-1.359,-1.034,-1.104,-1.921,-1.42,2,2,1,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,3,1
are no money not clear evidence why they came here like,-1.35,-0.687,-1.244,-1.019,1.265,0.303,-2.203,-1.688,-1.199,-1.144,-1.05,-1.028,-0.644,-0.939,0.501,-1.099,4,3,2,2,2,1,2,3,2,1,1,1
but then these yemenis people or not that case like they do to Korea,-1.419,-1.369,-1.359,-1.157,-0.324,-0.863,-0.118,-1.21,-1.186,-1.056,-1.044,-0.946,0.734,0.056,-1.484,-1.293,3,4,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
they may not allow us to make that decision so easily,-0.877,-0.784,-0.595,-0.973,4.315,3.791,0.959,-1.502,-1.319,-1.037,-1.267,-1.22,-0.325,-0.462,-0.191,-1.584,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
country in well well defined,-1.244,-1.041,-1.558,-1.306,-0.312,-0.904,-0.146,-1.603,-1.297,-0.85,-1.423,-1.231,-0.143,-0.182,-1.154,-1.31,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,4,2,1,1,1
to get accepted as a refugee but,-1.411,-1.312,-1.414,-1.343,-0.53,-0.731,-0.343,-1.773,-0.874,-1.128,-1.397,-1.103,-0.164,-0.791,-1.488,-1.463,3,3,2,2,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
think that we idealistically we should let these people in,-1.408,-1.401,-1.402,-1.15,-0.003,-0.082,-1.605,-1.441,-1.549,-1.509,-1.48,-1.421,-0.74,-1.141,-2.774,-1.88,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,1,1
of Korean citizens don't expect that,-1.403,-1.446,-1.467,-1.273,-0.746,-0.928,-1.337,-1.486,-1.218,-1.378,-1.186,-1.239,0.071,0.137,-1.239,-1.163,3,2,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
you said that the law makes the refugees movements illegal but,-1.434,-1.421,-1.544,-1.42,-0.618,-1.073,-2.593,-1.549,-1.375,-1.501,-1.441,-1.297,-0.544,-0.897,-1.461,-1.326,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,4,1,1,1,1
number of refugees increase like,-1.625,-1.413,-1.489,-1.381,-0.196,-0.845,-2.083,-1.75,-1.075,-0.355,-1.035,-0.603,1.976,1.858,1.826,-0.957,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
there was no problem in maintaining that particular acceptance rate if,-0.122,-0.697,-0.892,-0.586,-0.68,-0.808,-0.137,-0.35,-1.481,-1.426,-1.494,-1.334,-0.804,-1.04,-1.775,-1.796,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
profile like a shelter for for the,-1.638,-1.321,-1.382,-1.256,0.713,0.061,-1.975,-1.876,-1.13,-0.236,-0.965,-0.921,1.756,2.432,-0.158,-0.449,4,4,3,2,2,1,4,4,3,1,1,2
Americans so I think there's no proper reason,-1.695,-1.591,-1.498,-1.377,-1.032,-1.097,-1.299,-1.816,-1.634,-1.55,-1.543,-1.402,-0.658,-0.827,-2.446,-1.793,4,4,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
only a short title answer to sell that terrified only satisfies the,-1.262,-0.886,-1.02,-1.183,2.487,0.244,-0.298,-1.232,1.59,3.528,-0.25,-0.222,9.948,5.232,0.713,0.877,3,3,1,2,2,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
refugees to just blame them as like a you know they,-1.62,-1.217,-1.563,-1.347,-0.792,-0.99,-2.226,-1.574,-1.514,-1.307,-1.307,-1.162,-0.034,-0.254,-1.626,-1.27,3,2,2,2,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
without these are finished and a Spanish from medical,-0.846,-1.457,-1.395,-1.145,0.117,-0.615,-1.152,-1.46,0.356,0.464,-0.289,-0.741,4.244,0.074,-0.145,0.873,2,2,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
it's okay that Korea has said,-1.31,-0.529,-1.1,-1.256,0.84,-0.395,-1.107,-1.434,-1.301,-1.203,-1.275,-1.226,-0.678,-0.962,-0.68,-1.571,2,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
do how the police do for the refugees something like that so I think,-1.201,-0.425,-1.282,-1.107,0.847,0.072,-0.701,-0.748,-1.362,-1.417,-1.298,-1.312,0.965,0.31,-1.343,-1.546,4,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
and the yemeni people,-0.541,-0.262,-0.588,-0.803,5.155,2.892,0.611,-0.711,-1.264,-1.506,-1.486,-1.376,-0.51,-0.488,-1.113,-1.724,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
and even though not all of them I know that not all of them are,-1.5,-1.462,-1.569,-1.39,-0.921,-1.079,-1.791,-1.815,-1.527,-1.271,-1.306,-1.269,-0.354,-0.882,-0.956,-1.739,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
people first so if we look at an example of since breathtaking refugees is kind of a big,-1.284,-0.706,-1.398,-0.949,1.249,-0.297,-0.375,-1.096,-1.636,-1.525,-1.484,-1.306,-0.517,-0.202,-1.455,-1.683,2,3,2,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
I'm not very good at English and I'm the president so,-0.886,-1.343,-1.422,-1.131,-0.181,-0.953,-1.4,-1.946,-1.543,-1.163,-1.403,-1.328,0.028,-0.288,-1.795,-1.41,4,4,2,1,1,1,4,4,2,1,1,1
with Muslim backgrounds living in South South Korea and and therefore this,-1.431,-1.238,-1.428,-1.286,-0.656,-0.933,0.787,-1.756,-1.419,-1.519,-0.918,-1.276,2.011,0.826,-1.667,-1.096,4,3,1,2,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1
Jeju Island are there,-1.47,-1.525,-1.439,-1.328,-0.357,-0.689,-1.028,-1.613,-1.18,-1.169,-1.439,-1.317,-0.648,-1.097,-0.099,-1.337,4,3,2,2,2,1,2,3,2,1,1,1
that I think like it's just like 2% that Korean,-1.061,-0.568,-1.074,-0.897,1.152,0.872,0.258,-0.465,-1.381,-1.373,-1.336,-1.287,-0.077,-0.39,-1.481,-1.568,4,3,1,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
is really kind of different because you know Korea is like in your slowly opening,-0.788,-0.824,-1.373,-1.123,-0.169,-0.124,-0.971,-0.698,-1.229,-1.362,-1.559,-1.201,-0.902,-1.084,-1.95,-1.747,3,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
that you've stated you did you mentioned on government's role,-1.046,-1.031,-1.183,-0.989,0.336,0.544,-1.435,-1.292,-1.609,-1.249,-1.534,-1.413,-0.606,-0.818,-0.684,-1.774,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
because of the situations that I said beforehand I believe that Korea is not prepared,-1.282,-0.975,-1.342,-1.156,-0.249,-0.798,0.566,-1.151,-1.257,-1.351,-1.439,-1.268,-0.357,-0.758,-2.098,-1.482,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
like judging a book by it's cover I guess I definitely,-1.506,-1.506,-1.417,-1.299,-0.174,-0.688,-2.114,-1.478,-1.177,-1.56,-1.372,-1.269,0.036,-0.373,-1.962,-1.776,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,1,1
societies very low and therefore all these objections against the refugees,-1.566,-1.471,-1.559,-1.417,-0.79,-1.044,-1.767,-1.779,-1.016,-0.892,-1.175,-1.17,0.385,1.167,-0.835,-1.509,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
to add some points to what she has are good to begin with she has,0.493,0.1,-0.911,-0.618,2.424,1.722,-0.282,0.847,-1.501,-1.177,-0.624,-1.132,0.57,1.749,-1.62,-1.527,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
their first support from the US and then when Saddam Hussein died,-1.304,-0.886,-1.035,-1.057,0.198,0.195,-1.184,-1.488,-0.148,0.008,-0.705,-1.065,3.209,2.712,-0.154,-0.584,3,3,2,2,2,1,3,3,2,2,2,1
benefits if the Korean government letter reality,-1.341,-1.383,-1.472,-1.263,0.324,-0.197,-1.685,-1.746,-0.636,-1.153,-1.099,-0.818,0.48,0.784,1.854,-0.796,2,3,1,1,1,1,2,4,1,1,2,1
means people can work at their and and you have,-1.598,-1.611,-1.564,-1.362,-0.932,-1.046,-2.76,-1.786,0.371,0.627,2.117,1.004,15.136,14.534,1.502,1.119,2,3,2,1,1,1,2,3,2,1,2,1

each other for example Yemen is in the Middle East so it's,-1.136,-1.392,-1.532,-1.336,0.179,-0.532,-0.562,-1.426,-1.638,-1.552,-1.584,-1.427,-1.024,-1.14,-2.765,-1.901,3,2,1,1,1,1,3,4,1,1,1,1
us but we just still have don't know or just not being currently like,-0.714,-1.113,-0.781,-1.069,1.853,1.243,0.508,-0.65,-0.966,-1.381,-1.333,-1.339,0.056,-0.697,-0.554,-1.78,4,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
in Yemen didn't choose to start in Yemen with their life right and so if,-1.443,-1.264,-1.426,-1.279,0.196,-0.378,-1.351,-1.552,-1.352,-1.402,-1.359,-1.236,0.093,-0.766,-2.04,-1.98,3,4,2,2,2,1,3,3,3,1,1,1
main point is that,-1.363,-0.72,-1.163,-1.15,0.843,0.265,0.739,-0.389,-1.393,-1.342,-1.424,-1.222,0.438,0.143,1.726,-1.131,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,1,1,1
many other middle is confused horribly who have National,-0.711,-0.538,-1.158,-0.941,-0.767,-1.075,-0.794,-1.418,-1.621,-1.349,-1.488,-1.401,-0.7,-0.557,-1.125,-1.774,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,2,1,1,1
getting the support of America and they became this huge terrorist groups like,0.999,0.748,0.823,-0.913,5.385,9.645,-0.069,-0.788,-0.79,-0.842,-1.317,-1.181,1.019,0.175,-1.273,-1.286,4,3,2,2,2,1,3,3,2,2,2,1
some big refugees went to Europe to take jobs and,-1.257,-0.574,-1.351,-1.027,0.524,-0.45,-0.422,-0.849,-0.814,-0.615,-0.986,-1.158,1.49,-0.003,-0.918,-1.23,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,3,1
so it is already hard for Koreans to find jobs but now the refugee,-1.492,-0.755,-1.304,-1.293,0.615,-0.188,-1.145,-0.969,-1.496,-1.072,-1.393,-1.316,0.494,-0.643,-1.814,-1.627,3,3,2,2,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
if we look at Korea Korea is actually not voluntary,-1.375,-1.244,-1.199,-1.146,0.758,0.903,-0.104,-1.149,-0.342,0.879,-0.124,-0.344,4.919,4.167,-1.107,-0.354,4,3,1,1,3,1,3,2,1,1,2,1
they are abusing the law and so there was a petition to the blue house,-1.395,-1.144,-1.297,-1.243,0.564,-0.402,-1.807,-1.317,-1.325,-1.032,-1.383,-1.272,-0.374,-0.831,-0.15,-1.449,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
starts to come through yet and I think that,-1.432,-1.393,-1.407,-1.384,0.486,-0.518,-2.824,-1.893,-1.554,-1.233,-1.551,-1.365,-0.898,-1.174,-1.649,-1.553,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
okay so I think many of the problems like economic problems,-1.519,-1.103,-1.536,-1.365,-0.415,-0.906,-2.712,-1.779,-1.302,-1.383,-1.402,-1.252,-0.424,-0.587,0.085,-1.294,2,3,1,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
if you do love all those refugees because you know they're from the are upside people and then there are a lot,-1.683,-1.45,-1.57,-1.389,-0.767,-1.008,-2.324,-1.808,-1.409,-1.432,-1.517,-1.347,-0.703,-0.895,-1.874,-1.666,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,3,1
and the most powerful country in the world without the Multicultural multi culture of salad,-1.235,-0.863,-1.306,-1.189,-0.129,-0.325,0.477,-1.567,-1.13,-0.658,-1.391,-1.194,-0.484,-0.331,-0.79,-0.686,2,2,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
of the very wealthy have the variables we have a lot of money but the,-1.191,-1.172,-1.333,-1.276,-0.069,-0.046,-1.504,-1.786,-1.563,-1.361,-1.418,-1.313,-0.475,0.225,-1.908,-1.766,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
people with extremism which is a very valid argument I agree America especially has been facing this,-1.376,-1.347,-1.291,-1.33,-0.354,-0.118,-1.818,-1.43,-1.505,-1.229,-1.418,-1.233,-0.042,-0.463,-0.598,-1.206,4,3,2,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
there are people at the very bottom of the society chain that struggle to live,-0.334,-0.737,-0.619,-0.844,2.925,4.235,0.634,-0.461,-1.573,-1.523,-1.518,-1.427,-0.312,-0.915,-1.897,-1.912,3,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
so I think if you think about your population first and there are some so very that,-0.956,-1.112,-1.378,-1.084,-0.009,0.978,0.269,-1.298,-1.342,-1.445,-1.268,-1.141,0.515,-0.352,-2.152,-1.776,4,3,1,1,1,1,3,4,2,1,1,1
kind of feel like well this is not Korea so,-1.618,-0.985,-1.594,-1.431,-0.931,-1.145,-2.711,-1.899,-0.947,-1.263,-1.45,-1.306,-0.393,-0.458,0.348,-1.716,2,3,1,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
lives in this in this in this in this chaotic time period in,-0.977,-1.21,-0.944,-1.035,1.064,0.805,0.552,-1.186,-1.316,-1.376,-1.223,-1.193,-0.267,-0.119,-1.397,-0.722,2,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
compared to a lot of other countries for accepting many were refugees from many diverse backgrounds,-1.384,-0.873,-1.45,-1.329,-0.772,-1.108,-0.443,-1.606,-1.449,-1.306,-1.395,-1.303,-0.393,-0.724,-1.327,-1.027,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
Philippines Unfortunately they were terrorist attack in the South,-1.497,-1.265,-1.492,-1.348,-0.616,-0.777,-0.295,-1.329,-1.659,-1.587,-1.305,-1.422,-1.002,-1.176,-1.18,-1.999,3,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
make exceptions for those if Yemen crisis,-1.028,-1.048,-1.327,-1.139,1.434,-0.4,0.267,-0.818,-1.242,-1.308,-1.219,-1.332,0.022,-0.356,-1.905,-1.687,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
so it's kind of Epic buyers to sing by on the numbers and the last,-1.488,-1.364,-1.293,-1.264,0.512,0.564,-0.838,-0.732,-1.509,-1.627,-1.47,-1.418,-0.589,-0.909,-2.916,-2.082,3,4,2,2,2,1,3,2,2,1,1,1
have these this inter connect enter Europe,-1.418,-1.355,-1.145,-1.295,-0.127,-0.559,-2.337,-1.825,-1.416,-1.489,-1.406,-0.82,-0.096,-0.061,-1.669,-1.546,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,4,3,1,1,1
because as you know there's a there are some cases like,-1.461,-1.31,-1.069,-1.274,0.285,-0.424,-1.255,-1.184,-1.482,-1.113,-1.558,-1.369,-0.586,-1.08,-1.539,-0.37,3,3,2,2,2,1,3,3,2,2,2,2
can't help themselves who need help I think that,-0.813,-0.587,-1.039,-1.133,2.231,1.855,-0.182,-0.241,-1.475,-1.329,-1.231,-1.102,0.075,-0.32,-0.259,-1.561,4,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
right overall once again I want to repeat that I'm,-0.758,-0.26,-0.209,1.413,-0.496,0.054,-1.577,-0.32,-0.419,0.341,-0.817,-0.763,11.069,2.182,-0.251,-1.227,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
it looked also mention that they restricted to Jeju Island which is already,-1.579,-1.416,-1.568,-1.383,-0.705,-0.974,-1.263,-1.889,-0.944,-1.303,-1.391,-1.273,0.049,-0.697,-1.212,-1.046,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
also lots of European countries and lots of European countries most of,-1.386,-0.958,-1.391,-1.282,1.723,-0.432,0.139,-0.323,-1.097,-1.322,-1.345,-1.283,-0.276,-0.045,-1.981,-1.665,4,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
UN immigration but that does not mean that they have to take them a I haven't,-1.218,-1.167,-1.397,-1.215,-0.008,0.288,-0.716,-0.617,-1.284,-1.403,-0.982,-1.054,-0.481,-0.628,-0.575,-1.293,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
I agree with your idea that,-1.39,-1.535,-1.43,-1.367,-0.553,-0.923,-2.575,-1.961,-1.323,-0.608,-1.307,-1.1,0.201,-0.061,-1.486,-1.454,3,4,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
is needed to prepare the Korean citizens to accept,-1.468,-1.301,-1.383,-1.282,-0.632,-0.294,-1.14,-1.656,-1.233,-1.057,-1.083,-1.218,1.288,0.571,-0.522,-1.001,3,3,1,2,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
some man and then also the reason issue,-1.415,-0.86,-1.391,-1.31,0.312,-0.13,-0.973,-1.617,0.111,0.143,-0.095,-0.574,3.798,3.425,0.102,-0.769,3,3,2,2,2,1,4,3,3,1,1,1
are endangered by certain issues related to their,-1.419,0.221,-1.002,-1.114,0.534,-0.014,1.076,-1.423,-1.085,-0.688,-1.367,-1.134,0.305,-0.541,-1.05,-0.987,3,3,2,2,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
but but Korea also part,-1.695,-1.474,-1.566,-1.34,-0.907,-1.078,-2.517,-1.828,-1.359,-1.121,-1.369,-1.267,-0.413,-0.781,-0.521,-1.405,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
actually come from the younger generation of Korea even despite the more liberal,-0.275,-0.975,-0.938,-1.043,2.015,2.131,-0.223,-0.337,-1.604,-1.484,-1.573,-1.4,-1.061,-1.276,-2.93,-1.986,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1

it's like I think they just want to know,-0.837,-0.416,-0.69,-1.071,3.498,1.939,1.018,0.41,-1.07,-0.961,-1.06,-1.1,1.137,0.388,-0.582,-1.779,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
so a lot of young people are trying to get into these cheap laborers to if he,-1.624,-1.501,-1.531,-1.376,-0.308,-0.792,-2.652,-1.949,-1.284,-1.458,-1.214,-1.271,-0.291,-0.047,-0.942,-1.64,3,3,1,2,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
okay so it's our your first point was that you can you tell me your first one again,-1.573,-1.398,-1.526,-1.303,-0.975,-1.124,-2.863,-1.986,-0.562,-0.632,-0.956,-1.086,1.35,1.442,-0.053,-0.908,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
the government holds the responsibility to educate at least people,0.033,-0.317,-0.782,-0.657,-0.394,-0.264,0.32,-0.425,-0.977,-0.878,-1.218,-1.126,0.235,-0.396,-0.564,-1.307,4,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
I think I heard also the case where,-1.405,-1.379,-1.389,-1.25,-0.004,-0.553,-1.38,-1.17,-1.568,-1.436,-1.482,-1.331,-0.677,-0.879,-2.12,-1.858,3,3,2,2,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
that the country's somehow bound to respect even if a lot of countries,-1.603,-1.391,-1.296,-1.261,0.926,-0.224,-0.802,-1.273,-1.45,-1.586,-1.509,-1.392,0.025,-0.644,-2.675,-1.931,3,3,2,2,2,1,4,3,3,1,1,1

they're only here to seek shelter they're not here to terrorize or anything like that it can't cats eat for see anything like that but North Koreans coming,-1.384,-1.389,-1.53,-1.32,-0.85,-1.17,-2.7,-1.587,-1.161,-1.18,-1.176,-1.228,-0.375,-0.351,-1.019,-1.384,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,2,1,1,1
guessing they if they if they remain if they,-1.568,-1.455,-1.499,-1.374,-0.765,-1.009,-2.129,-1.371,-1.295,-1.224,-0.506,-0.454,-0.365,0.12,-1.295,-1.525,3,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
yemenis refugees haven't caused critical research paper so the prediction is,-0.764,-0.947,-1.324,-1.142,0.003,-0.482,0.496,-1.288,-1.315,-0.829,-1.014,-1.158,0.974,0.206,-2.29,-1.09,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,1,1
dangerous jobs so taking any revisions can can,-1.701,-1.583,-1.593,-1.454,-0.896,-1.065,-2.434,-2.018,1.179,0.911,-0.03,-0.164,3.196,2.678,-0.655,0.425,4,2,1,1,3,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
and there and this amount is much more than the 500 yemeni refugees and,-1.383,-1.098,-1.101,-1.113,-0.233,-0.312,-0.514,-0.94,-1.279,-0.883,-0.581,-1.262,1.287,1.855,-1.94,-1.2,4,3,1,2,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1

like if there are refugees coming over to Korea because they,-1.446,-1.169,-1.261,-1.283,-0.74,-0.999,-0.978,-1.819,-1.385,-1.254,-1.294,-1.271,-0.258,-0.238,-2.061,-1.542,3,4,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1

well since this is my final remarks I,-1.005,-0.648,-0.73,-0.995,-0.658,-0.848,-1.339,-1.192,-1.303,-1.124,-0.832,-0.544,0.318,-0.029,-1.002,-0.981,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
you're actually a bad person but not lying not for not allowing them to be in here and,-1.562,-1.207,-1.493,-1.384,-0.858,-1.089,-2.631,-1.839,-1.208,-1.327,-1.066,-1.073,0.012,-0.077,-0.753,-1.148,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,1,3,1
your daily with Lexa T is like it's not it's not if they're not clear for an hour so,-1.073,-0.358,-0.717,-1.143,1.163,2.592,0.507,-0.756,-1.55,-1.41,-1.392,-1.347,-0.225,0.152,-1.357,-1.823,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
should be guaranteed those humanitarian issues like they're eating sand clothing,-1.419,-0.401,-0.297,-0.567,-0.738,-0.823,-1.31,-1.02,-1.331,-1.22,-1.314,-1.129,3.4,-0.776,1.123,-1.33,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
also like he talked about the image making image set image of Korea could be damaged by,-1.47,-1.023,-1.33,-1.174,0.459,-0.559,-1.941,-1.125,-1.586,-1.359,-1.455,-1.255,-1.123,-1.136,-2.328,-1.771,3,2,1,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
they would start to Korea they would have the Korean mushroom tea and everything that comes with it,-1.558,-1.379,-1.494,-1.383,-0.236,-0.861,-0.944,-1.771,-1.535,-1.442,-1.511,-1.352,-0.308,-0.721,-2.264,-1.638,3,4,2,2,2,1,3,2,2,1,1,1
Constitution against humble yes so,-1.624,-1.476,-1.579,-1.359,-0.887,-1.184,-1.393,-1.843,-1.638,-1.509,-1.377,-1.411,-0.761,-0.947,-2.765,-1.988,4,4,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
Koreans are not letting them because they think they are racist and rapists and,-1.244,-0.924,-1.456,-1.338,-0.881,-1.003,-0.921,-1.544,-1.59,-1.525,-1.571,-1.411,-0.722,-1.133,-1.362,-1.839,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,2,1,1,2,1
and the gospel others but I think it's more important to look after our,0.662,1.079,-0.573,-0.936,1.763,-0.045,-0.229,-0.892,-1.542,-1.413,-0.88,-1.205,0.03,-0.046,-2.753,-1.88,2,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
okay so if I'm I'm for immigration I guess so,-1.536,-1.035,-1.458,-1.302,-0.39,-0.932,-1.65,-1.618,-1.048,-0.936,-1.032,-1.121,0.967,0.82,-0.592,-1.011,3,3,2,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
Nation probably did not prepared for this dramatic increase and,-1.56,-1.465,-1.315,-0.229,-0.921,-0.731,-0.808,-1.769,-0.812,0.207,-1.048,-0.978,0.759,2.315,-1.802,-1.31,2,2,1,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
with the hounds or J don't wash your hair properly so they can affect how people,-1.539,-1.1,-1.474,-1.369,-0.59,-0.981,-0.625,-1.729,0.352,0.233,0.902,-0.533,6.014,4.932,-0.127,-1.07,2,3,2,1,1,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
countries I do believe Korea is very,-1.197,-0.723,-0.784,-1.285,1.144,2.559,-0.426,-1.057,-0.826,-0.705,-1.093,-1.007,0.359,-0.297,-0.718,-1.209,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
Jeju Allah first of all I want to mention that the current,-0.815,-0.863,-0.997,-0.761,-0.581,-0.428,0.334,-1.033,-1.468,-1.423,-1.399,-1.324,-0.606,-0.812,0.359,-1.819,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
or different because,-1.083,-1.278,-1.209,-1.052,-0.034,-0.444,-0.744,-1.631,-1.627,-1.477,-1.296,-1.356,-0.821,-1.181,-2.863,-2.016,3,4,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
only the extremist why isn't there any Christian extremist who do that throw stones,-0.706,-0.251,-0.809,-0.6,2.128,2.795,0.168,-0.579,-1.271,-1.367,-1.375,-1.216,0.559,0.023,0.758,-1.222,2,3,2,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,1,1
that has and also to compare to another country,-1.28,-1.568,-1.166,-1.225,0.393,0.208,0.357,-0.949,-1.272,-1.033,-0.884,-1.183,0.298,0.489,-1.068,-1.451,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,4,1,1,2,1
can explain in this question and I think like all Korean maybe,-1.388,-1.082,-1.409,-1.285,-0.039,-0.326,-0.153,-1.513,-1.581,-1.62,-1.502,-1.426,-0.017,-0.199,-2.422,-1.933,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,4,2,1,2,1
to educate the people prior to this,-0.228,-0.166,-0.192,0.281,-0.275,-0.512,0.687,-0.539,-1.285,-1.386,-1.416,-1.235,-0.614,-0.894,-2.493,-1.628,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,2,1
staff also lawful and fair processes,1.168,1.715,1.074,1.227,0.549,1.932,0.922,0.07,-1.024,-0.676,-1.393,-1.205,13.583,-0.581,-0.654,-1.268,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
we are doing everything that is legal,-1.16,-0.577,-1.071,-0.798,-0.533,-0.68,-0.845,-0.907,-0.846,-0.969,-1.004,-0.715,1.036,1.405,-0.24,-0.69,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
and it also means that they just escaped,0.12,0.775,0.218,-0.769,10.311,4.695,0.419,0.077,-1.108,-0.901,-1.128,-1.259,-0.321,-0.756,-0.783,-1.761,3,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
I understand your idea but I think the case of USA,-0.106,-0.52,-0.926,0.016,2.788,1.515,1.314,-0.568,1.319,0.396,-0.879,-0.358,1.503,0.437,0.313,1.512,3,3,1,1,3,1,2,3,1,1,2,1
to say so if it's for my opinion are go men,-0.825,0.747,-0.998,-1.007,2.189,3.144,0.249,0.817,-1.007,-1.252,-1.318,-1.196,0.183,-0.57,-1.239,-1.741,4,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
and it's not good for the image also yeah and to,-1.485,-1.351,-1.35,-1.392,0.147,0.042,-0.76,-1.51,-1.569,-1.469,-1.286,-1.261,-0.126,-0.353,-0.865,-1.725,3,4,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
can come in so from now on it illegal and second,-0.451,0.283,-0.963,-0.845,4.14,2.005,0.595,-0.397,-1.542,-1.572,-1.4,-1.36,-0.781,-0.937,-2.796,-1.994,2,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
and culturally and to suddenly turn our backs on these refugees for in Desperate,-1.434,-1.304,-1.119,-1.206,0.563,0.389,-0.843,-1.612,-1.08,-0.946,-0.931,-1.117,0.957,0.101,-0.679,-1.196,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
man and five Koreans were five Korean people were brokers who,-1.349,-1.347,-1.409,-1.332,-0.408,-0.51,-0.41,-1.478,-1.647,-1.439,-1.568,-1.384,-0.801,-0.924,-2.584,-2.035,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
for Jeju Island as I know like there are not many like young people who stays in,-1.467,-1.399,-1.456,-1.305,0.054,-0.744,-2.762,-1.836,-1.583,-1.574,-0.47,-1.34,-0.178,-0.472,-3.049,-2.032,2,3,2,1,1,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
only lived in a very small number of people I think it's around 500 and even with that small,0.019,-0.387,-0.997,-0.808,0.315,-0.292,-0.394,-1.092,-1.645,-1.243,-1.542,-1.314,-1.018,-1.272,-2.196,-1.714,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
so for the first point of argument is that,-1.289,-1.381,-1.435,-1.316,-0.006,-0.515,0.248,-1.583,-1.454,-1.526,-1.498,-1.344,-0.839,-0.999,-1.171,-1.855,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
them is okay for people to actually get used to their culture and all,-1.497,-1.55,-1.407,-1.317,-0.572,-0.787,-3.028,-2.022,-1.378,-0.988,-1.452,-1.326,-0.562,-0.771,0.006,-0.267,3,3,1,2,1,1,3,3,1,2,1,1
are aside from that there are many problems in Korea as well which are,-1.476,-1.066,-1.455,-1.304,-0.946,-1.238,-1.683,-1.894,-1.59,-1.576,-1.527,-1.414,-0.872,-1.086,-0.468,-1.648,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
and well of course as I mentioned over and,0.658,0.469,-0.516,-0.339,0.516,-0.491,0.316,-0.624,-1.402,-1.268,-1.258,-1.168,0.555,-0.033,0.357,-1.366,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
only has to accept like 550 refugees which is a very small portion compared to what,-1.292,-1.211,-1.316,-1.266,0.551,-0.332,-0.192,-1.569,-0.903,-0.861,-1.25,-1.189,-0.245,-0.401,0.146,-1.866,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
I think in a condemnation tore,-1.215,-0.59,-1.263,-1.068,-0.557,-0.43,-1.419,-0.159,-1.513,-0.744,-1.563,-1.372,-0.383,-0.992,-1.368,-1.729,3,3,2,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,2
and Korean people because Vietnam and Korea are both,-1.104,-1.084,-1.172,-1.303,1.219,0.811,1.138,-0.929,1.77,2.522,2.57,1.687,9.435,10.112,0.891,-0.309,2,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
the SS right away sir topics now first,-1.465,-1.272,-1.484,-1.336,-0.299,-0.795,-1.462,-1.819,-1.432,-1.221,-1.222,-1.32,-0.115,-0.021,-1.311,-1.141,4,4,2,1,3,1,3,4,2,1,2,1
security of locals when we accepted at least to the Jeju Island or there enough,-1.428,-1.164,-1.453,-1.167,-0.671,-0.819,-1.673,-1.819,-0.88,-0.911,-0.951,-1.085,1.512,0.982,-0.164,-1.228,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
tourists is affected like tourists Jeju Island to is going to judge you island is affected,-0.953,-1.085,-1.209,-0.98,0.715,0.596,0.164,-1.372,-1.327,-0.552,-1.348,-1.228,0.826,-0.436,0.645,-0.554,3,3,1,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
yes so I think we should consider accepting them in systematic,-1.635,-1.535,-1.595,-1.425,-0.69,-1.102,-2.224,-1.825,-1.122,-1.097,-1.15,-1.14,0.048,-0.888,0.566,-1.451,4,3,1,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
call diversity and secondly some people worried for,0.904,-0.351,2.429,2.576,3.588,2.445,1.57,0.053,-0.805,-0.348,-1.192,-0.678,1.29,0.375,0.719,-0.497,2,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
will have difficulties settling in Korea but they don't have any choices they chose Korea,-1.493,-1.403,-1.565,-1.405,-0.181,-0.832,-2.472,-1.831,-0.911,0.886,-1.083,-1.041,0.982,1.004,1.024,-0.633,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
case for the Koreans who have like their their bodies the is like with the,-1.253,-1.277,-1.315,-1.043,0.059,-0.438,-0.319,-1.591,-0.795,-1.303,-0.853,-0.968,0.651,0.217,-0.22,-1.187,4,3,1,1,1,1,3,4,2,1,1,1
Korean warm move to the taxes actually go to the military,-1.322,-1.177,-1.428,-1.367,0.201,-0.066,-0.834,-1.279,-1.361,-1.496,-1.296,-1.227,-0.368,-0.227,1.05,-1.539,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
I believe,-1.639,-1.501,-1.552,-1.348,-0.948,-1.104,-2.622,-1.827,-1.482,-1.412,-1.29,-1.262,0.953,0.213,-1.495,-1.441,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
Florida to South Korea to policy of accepting a refugee is,-1.143,-1.221,-1.079,-0.998,0.591,1.681,-0.235,-1.086,-1.248,-1.08,-1.349,-1.107,0.219,0.054,1.201,-1.565,3,4,1,1,2,1,3,4,2,1,2,1
Korea so like I think it can be like spread over many places and like it,-1.412,-1.511,-1.359,-1.279,0.114,-0.454,-0.946,-1.46,-1.273,-1.474,-0.583,-1.22,-0.338,0.002,-2.21,-1.72,2,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
and German people are against a refugees movements and that's because there are so,-0.589,-1.233,-1.324,-1.129,1.027,0.294,-0.05,-0.159,-1.161,-0.64,-0.939,-1.081,0.605,0.635,0.613,-0.453,2,4,1,1,1,1,3,4,1,1,1,1

and cannot provide and for example like they have whole amount,-1.338,-1.338,-1.362,-1.224,-0.167,-0.395,-1.283,-1.501,-1.701,-1.59,-1.544,-1.428,-0.747,-0.993,-2.469,-2.026,3,4,2,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
as you know or young people there is very high unemployment rate,-1.475,-1.407,-1.454,-1.351,-0.244,-0.639,-0.038,-1.64,-1.494,-1.459,-1.34,-1.4,-0.612,-0.555,-2.838,-1.991,4,3,2,1,1,1,2,3,2,1,1,1
examine their urgent needs and whether they are really in threat in there,0.756,0.078,0.85,0.05,-0.019,-0.24,0.075,-0.362,-1.313,-1.177,-1.484,-1.303,-0.342,-0.837,-0.77,-1.924,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
mention a little bit different view point of this,-0.549,0.225,-0.433,-0.562,0.08,-0.274,0.055,0.472,-0.445,-0.297,-0.86,-0.216,3.507,2.99,-0.391,-0.406,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
government us proof about the Visa order represent,-1.272,-1.186,-0.952,-1.348,1.071,0.798,0.315,-1.197,-1.298,-1.33,-1.268,-1.32,-0.083,-0.539,-0.91,-1.363,4,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
and what we but I want to point out is that if this law,0.331,-0.293,1.268,1.344,-0.112,0.46,0.351,0.118,-1.385,-1.444,-1.515,-1.296,-0.807,-0.724,-2.815,-1.926,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
as if it's not as if there was money allocated for the pole to pole in Korean,-0.732,-0.232,-0.628,-0.833,3.484,3.01,0.755,0.64,-1.356,-1.252,-1.221,-1.092,0.165,-0.315,1.708,-0.463,2,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
well although I do agree that some humanitarian effort,-0.598,-0.723,-0.993,-1.023,2.858,1.016,0.046,-0.988,-1.573,-1.562,-1.574,-1.368,-0.767,-1.105,-2.585,-1.868,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
with a much more limited population so yeah,-1.434,-1.23,-1.423,-1.306,-0.384,-0.304,-0.373,-1.213,-1.53,-1.479,-1.532,-1.404,-0.953,-1.156,-2.684,-1.904,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
refugees but well let's go back to the represent convention,1.008,0.98,0.122,1.603,0.424,1.805,-0.115,0.477,-1.386,-0.801,-0.951,-0.843,-0.14,-0.616,-0.286,-1.181,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
and that has been shifted towards the yemeni people I'm,-0.891,-0.802,-0.789,-1.156,2.305,2.292,0.513,-0.698,-1.069,-1.317,-1.291,-1.261,0.304,-0.595,-0.769,-0.483,2,3,1,1,2,1,4,3,1,1,1,1
increased number of refugees that came to Korea will,-1.632,-1.502,-1.333,-1.304,1.532,0.425,-2.604,-1.683,-1.479,-1.488,-1.449,-1.335,-0.654,-0.963,-2.326,-1.899,3,3,2,2,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
young adults and the already employed labor force also then another point we can make,-1.54,-1.181,-1.511,-1.266,-0.685,-0.837,-2.071,-1.754,-1.37,-0.754,-1.137,-0.847,0.175,0.306,0.651,-1.155,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
refugees data to the other nations nationality,-1.656,-1.351,-1.388,-1.344,-0.636,-0.71,-1.14,-1.616,-1.154,-1.229,-1.381,-1.18,-0.281,-0.356,-1.058,-1.722,3,4,1,1,2,1,4,4,2,1,1,1
happier that never seen something like that paid more than others,-1.38,-1.425,-1.418,-1.255,0.184,-0.199,-2.042,-1.762,-1.329,-1.406,-1.35,-1.167,0.287,-0.154,-0.338,-1.738,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,4,2,1,2,1
opposed to in part judgment on things well so it's important for to keep,-1.439,-1.243,-1.23,-1.077,0.917,1.249,-1.143,-1.631,-1.388,-1.334,-1.333,-1.27,-0.011,-0.18,-1.683,-1.317,3,3,2,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
so in that case I think Korean people need to change a lot and need to invest a lot not just in not such like,-1.322,-0.774,-1.091,-1.137,-0.029,-0.099,-0.354,-1.129,2.643,2.92,3.013,1.043,7.692,8.769,0.663,1.95,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
is not compatible but it's all saying to Israel saying to the other vendors,-1.479,-1.373,-1.606,-1.415,-0.677,-1.082,-1.986,-1.706,-1.318,-1.495,-1.288,-1.303,-0.416,-0.909,-1.804,-1.674,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
it better to focus on Korean people first when you develop Korea because Korean people that,-1.406,-0.979,-1.124,-1.342,1.02,1.427,-1.295,-1.72,0.013,-1.076,0.247,-0.074,4.078,2.6,-1.379,-0.66,3,2,1,2,3,1,3,3,1,2,2,1
how much actually goes into the tree and how little goes into public service,-0.782,-0.495,-0.529,-0.655,3.798,3.446,0.639,-0.34,-1.581,-1.241,-1.476,-1.315,-0.299,-0.046,-0.415,-1.455,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
part of current it can still be viewed as an extension of Korea that was just simply divided because the war,-1.45,-1.18,-1.491,-1.334,-0.56,-0.813,-1.953,-1.501,-1.337,-1.486,-1.489,-1.4,-0.746,-0.624,-2.952,-2.003,3,3,1,1,2,1,4,3,2,1,1,1
then it is also it's not really one-sided it's intervene a fishery for example if something happens,-0.635,-0.079,-0.371,-0.69,-0.478,-0.464,-0.05,-0.429,-0.885,-0.968,-0.627,-0.592,0.282,0.202,-0.305,-0.686,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
position I would like to assert that I would like to bring out the question of the,-1.182,-1.057,-1.286,-1.234,-0.137,-0.836,-2.104,-1.68,0.57,0.017,-0.244,-0.457,7.245,3.335,-0.769,0.401,3,2,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1

of the United Nations has signed at the convention so they also have the international obligation,-1.645,-1.587,-1.612,-1.452,-1.078,-1.293,-2.849,-2.043,-1.265,-0.996,-1.329,-1.231,-0.512,-0.035,-0.13,-1.344,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
than the lives of these people these poor people,-1.287,-1.18,-1.184,-1.197,0.21,0.172,0.126,-0.408,-1.435,-1.062,-1.516,-1.299,-0.914,-1.08,-1.903,-1.671,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
I think they're already a lot of foreigners and Koreans I think it's normal,-1.407,-1.051,-1.436,-1.303,-0.209,-0.342,-0.827,-1.455,-1.351,-1.304,-0.878,-0.961,0.141,-0.398,-0.623,-1.472,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,2,2,2
culturally they keep a lot of ground rules but those people extremists,-1.549,-1.396,-1.556,-1.348,-0.755,-1.005,-2.793,-1.609,-1.115,-1.17,-1.164,-1.151,1.863,1.191,-0.639,-1.285,2,4,2,2,2,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
against these refugees or in general against work for foreigners coming in,-0.012,-0.008,-0.365,1.516,0.731,0.456,0.746,1.118,-0.744,-1.247,-1.139,-1.164,0.006,-0.477,-0.678,-1.525,2,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
I think in that regard we're not ready in the social and cultural mask,-1.106,-0.047,-1.121,-0.838,0.143,1.272,-0.929,-1.525,-1.429,-0.677,-1.349,-1.26,-0.383,-0.369,-1.572,-1.561,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
I think a lot of these are backed by stereotypes and wrong information so correcting that I think will fix some of the issues,-0.673,-1.108,-0.765,-0.943,2.181,1.936,0.558,-1.378,-1.607,-1.393,-1.587,-1.425,-0.78,-1.203,-2.413,-1.904,3,3,2,1,1,1,4,3,2,1,2,1
but I just think that it's like a special,-1.377,-1.086,-1.309,-1.043,1.634,1.329,-0.718,-1.467,-1.415,-1.076,-1.306,-1.18,-0.239,-0.135,-1.364,-1.402,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,4,2,1,1,1
it is it all okay yeah for local IT jobs,-1.391,-1.54,-1.531,-1.372,-0.651,-0.948,-2.445,-1.861,-1.55,-1.561,-0.863,-1.285,0.149,-0.616,-3.046,-2.103,2,3,2,1,1,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
that's it for me so,-1.577,-1.509,-1.52,-1.36,-0.429,-0.743,-2.444,-1.71,-1.445,-1.53,-1.46,-1.218,-0.062,-0.55,-1.98,-1.827,3,3,1,2,1,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
the word or situation and also,-1.684,-1.545,-1.574,-1.44,-0.708,-1.134,-2.862,-1.958,-1.025,-1.222,-0.861,-1.164,-0.415,-0.477,-0.92,-1.474,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,1,2,1
for example Vietnam China or other nearby country however,-1.353,-1.361,-1.223,-1.065,0.139,0.283,-0.131,-1.557,0.773,0.949,1.039,-0.597,5.264,3.956,-0.686,0.357,2,2,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
they got the Weaponry from the America before before said I was saying died so they,-0.743,-0.46,-1.212,-1.095,0.258,0.047,-1.298,-0.846,-0.723,-0.81,-1.132,-1.076,2.595,1.922,-1.216,-1.207,3,3,2,2,2,1,3,3,2,2,2,1
of sudden a incoming of a large number of people in the general,0.866,0.285,0.667,-0.603,0.457,1.246,-0.44,0.816,-1.442,-1.31,-1.389,-1.188,-0.661,-0.92,-2.456,-1.801,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
system right it they are basically allowing it but once it happens,-1.27,-1.344,-1.493,-1.327,-0.054,-0.472,0.286,-1.752,-0.953,-0.883,-0.984,-1.009,0.147,0.106,-1.997,-0.616,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
and of course it should be all based on the legal legal boundary we have to,-0.724,0.934,-0.309,-0.814,-0.677,-0.343,-0.31,0.484,-1.419,-0.917,-1.407,-1.276,-0.443,-0.883,-0.958,-1.411,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
I'm not saying that we should just stop accepting all those people because of fear and,-1.624,-1.452,-1.534,-1.419,-0.699,-1.138,-2.555,-1.916,-1.287,-1.528,-1.343,-1.184,-0.624,-1.034,-0.7,-1.631,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1

I think there is no one who can be responsible for the point so we cannot,-1.583,-1.581,-1.606,-1.429,-0.831,-1.039,-2.528,-2.054,-1.341,-1.515,-1.085,-1.167,0.919,-0.966,-1.202,-1.844,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
to like connect to be 70s and or be more compassionate towards them so yeah it's,-1.562,-1.24,-1.499,-1.341,-0.804,-0.887,-2.101,-1.586,-1.525,-1.369,-1.469,-1.36,-0.795,-1.045,-1.305,-1.521,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,1,1

well just seeing the Christ Community of the separation between the international population,-1.298,-1.249,-1.448,-1.219,-0.78,-0.731,-2.132,-1.527,-1.587,-1.221,-1.288,-1.33,-0.28,-0.63,-1.339,-1.412,3,3,1,2,1,1,4,3,1,1,2,1

of immigrant from other country right but most of them as far as I know come from Asian country and,-1.356,-1.183,-1.406,-1.38,-0.235,-0.132,-0.15,-1.233,1.787,2.303,4.979,0.349,7.945,4.867,0.628,1.263,2,2,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
that technically belong to the younger generation however what I like to argue is,-1.501,-1.355,-1.241,-1.306,0.787,0.045,-2.212,-1.882,-1.576,-0.696,-1.284,-1.193,0.746,-0.362,-1.916,-1.154,3,3,2,1,1,1,4,3,2,1,2,1
home country is becoming Wheels good get better and they can,-1.495,-1.399,-1.38,-1.338,-0.442,-0.941,-2.792,-1.842,-0.853,-1.048,-1.367,-1.152,-0.072,-0.66,-0.934,-1.409,4,3,1,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
because people from that area area,-1.359,-1.334,-1.402,-1.293,0.109,-0.294,-0.55,-1.292,-0.134,-1.051,-0.318,-0.928,3.955,4.372,-1.186,-1.678,2,3,2,1,1,1,4,4,1,2,1,1
than all those small menial jobs would just then go to refugees and in a way it would help Korean,-1.684,-1.539,-1.604,-1.434,-1.056,-1.204,-2.681,-1.956,-1.425,-0.864,-1.094,-1.223,0.749,1.525,-0.546,-1.322,2,3,2,1,1,1,4,4,3,1,2,1
at the case kill people who commit adultery,-0.706,-0.943,-0.878,-0.979,1.233,1.577,2.35,-1.463,-1.522,-1.406,-1.124,-1.255,1.807,2.13,-0.354,-0.62,2,3,2,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,1,1
perspective of like like this nationalism,-1.519,-1.324,-1.571,-1.422,-0.842,-1.005,-2.178,-1.706,-1.393,-1.475,-1.518,-1.334,-0.412,-0.537,-2.846,-1.787,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
us at the strongest is why not be applicable to the current situation right now and,-1.32,-1.077,-1.197,-1.029,0.001,-0.16,-1.651,-1.557,0.395,-0.22,0.605,0.083,5.42,4.786,2.011,0.247,4,3,1,1,2,1,3,2,1,1,2,1
are parks was actually French people it's French national tea,-1.551,-1.197,-1.386,-1.291,0.335,-0.267,-0.874,-1.486,-1.189,-1.331,-1.387,-1.214,0.18,-0.294,-2.308,-1.762,3,4,2,2,2,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
should not be,-1.393,-1.143,-1.326,-1.225,-0.784,-0.986,0.656,-1.731,-1.678,-1.48,-1.396,-1.4,-0.513,-0.854,-2.867,-2.014,3,3,1,2,3,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
people especially because it's only the island of JeJu and judge it was a very small part of Korea,-1.323,-1.396,-1.328,-1.254,0.169,0.054,-1.303,-1.363,-1.369,-1.294,-1.399,-1.301,-0.89,-0.954,-1.862,-1.657,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
hundreds thousands of refugees so I'll start with that and,-1.232,-0.752,-1.215,-1.134,-0.454,-0.555,-0.441,-0.486,-1.376,-0.044,-1.274,-1.2,0.087,-0.273,1.954,-0.745,4,3,1,1,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
well first of all judges like a visa-free island so they can stay for 30,-1.124,-0.809,-0.997,-1.117,3.289,1.381,0.31,-0.206,-0.897,-1.157,-1.17,-1.268,0.207,0.171,-0.218,-1.068,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,4,1,1,1,1
but regarding the development of Korea I think that is,-1.474,-0.864,-1.397,-1.203,-0.122,0.271,-0.042,-1.499,-0.702,-0.607,-0.257,-1.013,3.068,1.418,-0.84,-0.956,3,2,1,2,2,1,3,3,1,2,2,1
a lot of people I mean,-1.732,-1.65,-1.621,-1.462,-1.063,-1.278,-2.639,-1.972,-0.993,-1.051,-1.108,-1.297,0.369,-0.97,-0.701,-1.811,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
in my opinion,-1.623,-1.19,-1.409,-1.218,0.101,-0.103,-1.076,-0.683,-1.55,-1.253,-1.4,-1.216,-0.235,-0.65,-2.121,-1.509,3,3,3,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
resources high and South Korea is not big enough to take in any more foreigners and for labor force so,-1.602,-1.17,-1.433,-1.221,-0.199,-0.641,-1.519,-1.508,-1.527,-1.513,-1.429,-1.395,0.468,-0.463,-2.206,-1.958,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
the country and in addition to my,-1.308,-1.227,-1.347,-1.151,0.332,-0.405,-0.824,-1.361,-0.837,0.795,-0.466,-0.989,3.568,3.427,-0.152,-0.868,3,2,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,1,2,1
I think that is would be have some positive,-1.222,-1.019,-1.381,-1.261,1.088,0.564,-0.168,-1.671,-1.541,-1.268,-1.392,-0.812,0.314,-0.022,-2.355,-1.115,2,3,1,1,1,1,2,4,2,1,2,1
isn't all work isn't ready to accept these refugees however in considering an economic,-1.185,-0.839,-1.275,-1.088,0.663,-0.221,-0.1,-1.001,-1.165,-0.913,-0.538,-0.925,2.382,4.061,-0.109,-0.494,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1

only 550 people so it is the first thing that I think,-1.137,-0.747,-1.114,-1.132,0.303,0.075,-0.812,-1.329,-0.957,-1.425,-1.317,-1.067,-0.481,-0.682,-0.933,-1.687,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,4,1,1,2,1
it will be good so I think it's not good if we accept all,-0.034,0.884,-0.993,-0.81,2.887,3.138,-0.963,-0.366,-1.082,-0.998,-1.216,-1.145,0.143,-0.223,-1.714,-1.612,3,3,1,1,2,1,4,4,2,1,2,1

sure we should accept refugees but our state our situation isn't very good right now so I think,-1.503,-1.065,-1.391,-1.144,0.433,0.267,0.924,-1.331,-1.649,-1.577,-1.555,-1.413,-0.981,-1.11,-1.658,-1.662,3,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,1,1

in that sense you know it might affect Fame Alec,-1.486,-1.333,-1.419,-1.285,-0.281,-0.617,-2.02,-1.785,-1.526,-1.509,-1.502,-1.339,-0.709,-0.709,-0.487,-1.745,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,3,1
Island for the I saw Asylum so I think the government,-1.372,-1.176,-1.342,-1.216,0.369,-0.555,-1.893,-0.538,-1.24,-1.048,-1.338,-1.093,0.119,0.687,0.102,-0.854,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
and I selected religion I'm that about Muslims and the Quran and the Quran,-1.154,-1.213,-0.801,-1.25,0.982,1.201,-0.166,-1.657,-1.493,-1.416,-1.286,-1.306,-0.137,0.425,-2.83,-1.975,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
for example you know with any government,-0.268,-0.199,-0.604,-0.942,3.858,3.236,-0.533,-0.21,-1.636,-1.133,-1.432,-1.37,-0.357,-0.767,-1.377,-1.749,2,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,1,1
but what about this Showcase of buildings Stone women who don't wear,-0.849,-0.892,-0.78,-0.674,2.886,3.53,-0.12,-0.547,-1.044,-0.61,-0.974,-1.134,1.659,2.231,-0.776,0.033,2,3,2,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,1,1
because there are more young people because again the numbers only 500 and also,-1.51,-1.56,-1.499,-1.292,-0.292,-0.746,-1.52,-1.6,-1.278,-1.011,-1.519,-1.289,-0.43,-1.094,-1.151,-1.593,3,3,1,2,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
by person by person but it's all they guaranteed,-0.233,1.192,0.9,-0.743,0.068,0.298,2.279,1.251,-1.543,-1.358,-1.383,-1.186,-0.252,-0.656,-1.278,-1.907,3,2,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
isn't helped by jihadists sharing some sort of like,-1.597,-1.533,-1.437,-1.356,0.345,-0.304,-2.258,-1.857,-1.359,-1.339,-1.139,-1.089,0.34,0.052,-0.208,-1.331,2,4,2,2,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1
I think there's some kind of more emotional than rational equations,-1.268,-1.211,-1.414,-1.13,0.132,-0.108,-1.958,-1.425,-1.314,-0.996,-1.328,-1.252,1.28,0.745,-1.293,0.315,4,3,1,1,1,1,4,4,2,1,2,1
like people are saying well this is because of the refugee and everything but it turns out to be FALSE so I think,-0.684,-0.898,-1.037,-1.15,0.547,-0.095,0.446,-0.193,-1.415,-0.973,-1.501,-1.224,0.129,-0.734,-0.716,-1.004,3,3,2,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,2
as I think that if they just put the country in the list is,-1.243,-1.038,-1.168,-1.105,0.976,0.054,-1.322,-1.283,-1.469,-0.509,-1.455,-1.3,-0.117,-0.3,-1.265,-1.318,4,4,2,1,2,1,3,4,3,1,2,1
to apply for energy but cannot expect but get the rejection from that,-1.409,-1.551,-1.484,-1.253,-0.533,-0.722,-1.761,-1.364,-1.478,-1.311,-1.248,-1.167,0.23,0.55,-1.52,-1.828,3,4,1,1,2,1,4,4,2,1,1,1
known for its many Chinese and other country of immigrants so it's not,-1.504,-1.218,-1.279,-1.125,0.061,-0.414,-1.208,-1.662,-1.476,-1.491,-1.379,-1.31,-0.093,-0.498,-1.944,-1.707,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
of the religion you go to heaven okay,-1.646,-1.462,-1.515,-1.448,-0.976,-1.102,-2.765,-2.068,-1.334,-0.3,-0.829,-1.197,2.887,1.638,-0.381,-1.085,3,3,2,1,1,1,2,3,2,1,1,1
I heard that almost every foreigners cannot speak,-1.664,-1.502,-1.494,-1.386,-0.689,-0.423,-1.598,-1.577,-0.826,0.208,-0.931,-1.244,0.601,-0.577,-0.931,-1.198,3,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,2,1
like so the first reason why disagree with accepting refugees,-1.512,-1.198,-1.254,-1.174,-0.803,-1.073,-1.414,-1.92,-1.607,-1.502,-1.521,-1.405,-0.405,-0.783,-1.409,-1.729,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
on the fact that these are histories are allowed to have it for long probation,-1.273,-1.243,-1.433,-1.247,0.08,-0.445,-0.452,-1.665,-1.661,-1.581,-1.595,-1.44,-1.044,-1.223,-2.575,-1.968,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
these years thousand North Koreans came to this country and you know if you think about,-0.486,-0.882,-0.64,-0.421,5.4,3.356,1.454,0.152,-1.24,-1.471,-1.482,-1.352,-0.626,-0.738,-1.404,-0.926,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
Yemen position themselves to be our position because like for example people,-1.096,-0.423,-1.235,-0.906,0.675,-0.107,-0.56,0.02,-1.563,-1.389,-1.537,-1.347,-0.539,-0.955,-2.378,-1.821,3,3,2,2,2,1,3,3,3,1,1,1
people in Korea are prepared to accept refugees well I would like to say I,-1.171,-1.14,-1.197,-1.16,-0.364,-0.247,-0.416,-1.69,-1.334,-1.245,-1.024,-1.103,1.072,1.589,-0.575,-0.962,3,3,1,2,1,1,4,3,1,1,2,1
to kind of filter on this like actual refugees right I also agree with the,-0.399,-0.907,-0.985,-0.603,1.117,1.169,0.793,-1.037,-1.239,-1.515,-1.45,-1.34,-0.277,-0.562,-0.592,-1.535,2,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,3,1
people from other countries however as time passes many people,-1.295,-1.23,-1.069,-1.15,-0.09,0.035,-1.166,-0.57,-0.703,-0.927,-1.107,-0.9,-0.608,-0.613,-0.638,0.111,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
Island feel like with anger from them even one of my friends who's from Georgia Island always,-1.138,-0.915,-1.356,-1.255,0.198,-0.519,0.02,-0.564,-1.485,-1.485,-1.555,-1.323,-0.908,-1.032,-2.142,-1.86,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
Commander being a refugee yeah it's,-1.504,-1.328,-1.282,-1.312,0.366,-0.156,-1.239,-1.403,-1.492,-1.43,-1.56,-1.429,-0.653,-0.949,-1.924,-2.0,4,3,2,1,2,1,3,4,2,1,2,1
today some Christians in Greek,-1.513,-1.144,-1.465,-1.295,-0.75,-0.821,-2.626,-1.758,-1.654,-1.48,-1.329,-1.1,0.241,0.817,-2.323,-1.932,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,2,1,1,1
I do urge them you have to assign more and more research has to this Romanian refugees at least,0.137,0.034,1.2,1.567,-0.009,0.284,-0.289,0.588,-1.254,-1.493,-1.406,-1.231,-0.343,-0.854,-0.973,-1.519,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
because at first the judges City whole tried to give and when people drop,-0.365,-0.51,-1.381,-1.187,0.489,-0.203,-0.8,-0.928,-1.547,-1.302,-1.41,-1.338,-0.248,-0.634,-1.56,-1.734,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
international students and there are a lot of there were a lot of friends who,-1.683,-1.488,-1.539,-1.439,-0.637,-1.094,-2.665,-1.972,-0.678,-1.038,-1.092,-0.806,-0.111,-0.603,0.283,-0.854,2,2,1,1,2,1,3,4,1,1,3,1
we speculate that majority have come to Korea for just,-1.515,-1.263,-1.391,-1.281,-0.077,-0.356,-1.535,-1.226,-1.338,-1.426,-1.392,-1.268,-0.516,-0.675,-2.438,-1.318,4,3,2,2,2,1,2,3,2,1,1,1
no way to Christian Stone them no Chris no but,-0.633,-0.636,-1.279,-0.901,0.408,0.446,0.316,-1.139,-1.479,-1.401,-1.486,-1.374,0.21,-0.178,-1.38,-1.549,2,3,2,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,1,1
to sort out rather than just blocking all those refugees and,-1.652,-1.471,-1.571,-1.341,-1.082,-1.293,-2.589,-1.86,0.233,0.58,-0.779,-0.839,1.638,1.077,0.918,-1.03,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,3,1
it's I think that it's time for Korea to break down the Monokuma no culturalism,-1.538,-1.215,-1.534,-1.339,0.592,-0.891,-1.973,-1.906,-1.419,-1.399,-1.486,-1.33,-1.068,-1.244,-2.007,-1.025,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
you know even even us it's one of the country that says a lot of refugees from other countries,-1.629,-1.619,-1.553,-1.439,-0.841,-1.221,-2.481,-1.958,-1.557,-1.315,-1.55,-1.325,-0.691,-0.938,-2.436,-1.759,2,3,1,2,2,1,3,4,2,1,2,1
in South Korea and what I want what I just want to mention is that they're not,-0.179,-0.424,-0.786,-1.041,-0.67,-0.656,0.655,-0.643,-1.416,-0.713,-1.199,-1.031,-0.311,-0.312,0.167,-1.403,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,1,1
image is important but that's out,-1.43,-1.364,-1.515,-1.288,-0.548,-0.977,-0.587,-1.62,-1.084,-1.112,-1.404,-1.132,-0.613,-0.923,-0.042,-1.378,3,2,1,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,3,1
to emphasize that it's not going to create damage but impact and if it does it is possible to,-0.858,-0.337,-0.631,-1.029,2.375,0.826,1.072,-0.484,-1.387,-1.252,-1.549,-1.295,-0.221,-0.603,-0.913,-1.516,2,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
who are applying for jobs that it could go to Koreans doesn't necessarily mean that they're not taking,-1.0,-1.393,-1.458,-1.302,-0.216,-0.778,-0.806,-1.388,-1.329,-1.09,-1.143,-1.057,1.233,1.705,-0.95,-1.019,3,3,2,1,2,1,4,4,2,1,2,1
despite the fact despite the fact that on the global scale we already have,-1.197,-1.204,-1.441,-1.182,-0.111,-0.345,0.056,-1.184,-1.697,-1.549,-1.581,-1.408,-0.932,-1.21,-2.199,-1.907,2,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
so people get it's a basic human rights,-1.531,-1.49,-1.374,-1.378,-0.663,-1.14,-1.326,-1.696,-0.96,-0.129,-0.604,-1.046,2.36,2.93,-0.648,0.074,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
humanitarian than economics even if the economics is to take into account,-1.385,-1.422,-1.455,-1.273,-0.119,-0.504,-0.031,-1.509,-1.561,-1.341,-1.511,-1.4,-0.745,-1.121,-1.712,-1.632,3,4,2,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,2,1

disagree on that point because the nation has seen a dramatic,-1.262,-1.402,-1.422,-1.246,-0.251,-0.654,0.565,-1.446,-1.196,-1.348,-1.07,-1.163,1.243,0.735,-0.923,-1.453,3,3,1,2,3,1,3,3,1,1,1,1

to military Middle East Country so yeah I don't think there is,-1.08,-0.497,-1.118,-1.124,0.916,0.204,0.701,-0.433,-1.194,-1.141,-1.304,-1.285,-0.547,-0.599,-2.369,-1.738,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,4,1,1,1,1
about these conventions and are the country's responsibility International,1.481,-0.018,0.086,0.028,0.595,0.177,1.505,3.024,-0.909,-0.703,-1.025,-0.639,0.721,0.204,-0.211,-1.469,4,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
and then second novel like people escaping crisis well the humanitarian argument,-1.531,-1.551,-1.405,-1.252,-0.534,-0.835,-2.318,-1.555,-1.162,-1.096,-1.099,-0.862,0.345,-0.112,-0.996,-1.295,3,3,1,2,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
this issue and they they have accepted nearly like 1,-1.223,-1.27,-1.248,-1.303,0.387,-0.107,-1.54,-1.598,-1.371,-1.504,-1.519,-1.32,-0.501,-1.046,-0.918,-1.498,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
so we should so maybe it's a small proportion but,-1.594,-1.597,-1.557,-1.433,-0.577,-0.879,-2.91,-2.041,-1.632,-1.459,-1.52,-1.35,-0.719,-1.066,-0.736,-1.872,3,3,2,2,2,1,2,3,1,1,1,2
intuition and xenophobic phobic is definitely not tolerated but there,-1.049,-1.36,-1.444,-1.212,0.122,-0.48,-1.159,-1.034,-0.584,-0.478,-1.298,-0.893,-0.256,-0.428,0.241,-1.168,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
of their country to develop but career has already developed and this infrastructure and Miss political,-1.275,-0.621,-1.355,-1.211,-0.118,0.512,-1.725,-1.207,0.589,0.511,0.32,0.269,3.283,3.838,0.17,-0.341,4,3,1,1,2,1,3,2,1,1,2,1

so the main topic is about like being,-1.575,-1.344,-1.532,-1.278,-0.771,-1.107,-0.96,-1.7,-1.605,-1.17,-1.433,-1.251,-0.555,-0.907,-1.357,-1.148,2,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,3,1
kick kick them out of the country so that is acceptable and,-1.623,-1.404,-1.531,-1.36,-0.512,-0.949,-2.986,-1.82,-1.157,-1.33,-1.494,-1.298,-0.268,-0.318,-1.077,-1.606,3,3,1,2,1,1,3,3,1,2,1,1
of a country and that that country has its own government and the government is supposed to work in,-1.11,-0.956,-1.079,-0.821,1.279,1.207,-0.014,-0.865,-1.281,-1.428,-1.435,-1.381,0.004,-0.827,-3.004,-2.004,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,1,1

and we'll start now so it isn't their,-1.545,-1.25,-1.431,-1.219,-0.151,0.144,-2.442,-1.726,-1.447,-1.314,-1.352,-1.331,-0.069,-0.685,-2.535,-1.841,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
I think Korea so far participate on a little compared to,-0.889,-1.145,-1.095,-1.145,0.298,0.006,0.002,-1.347,-1.243,-0.565,-1.342,-1.25,-0.153,-0.34,-0.393,-1.538,4,3,1,1,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,1

Korean economy and also I have doubt that the,-0.972,-0.991,-1.016,-1.053,0.365,-0.167,-0.398,-1.291,-1.41,-1.063,-1.331,-1.248,-0.031,-0.4,-0.97,-0.891,3,3,1,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
in I guess correcting this issue but at the same time I think what might be even,-1.348,-1.401,-1.384,-1.356,-0.483,-0.398,-1.48,-1.642,-1.461,-1.435,-1.524,-1.323,-0.8,-1.035,-2.519,-1.663,3,3,2,1,1,1,4,3,2,1,2,1
and and in order for example if you want to get them in I,-1.525,-1.589,-1.284,-1.374,-0.037,-0.656,-1.232,-1.633,2.05,6.85,3.143,0.503,11.119,2.968,-0.881,0.766,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,2,1,1
it's it has become a hot place for tourists so there are many reasons,-1.207,-0.782,-1.248,-1.219,1.713,0.069,-1.352,-1.253,-0.782,0.17,-0.729,-0.849,1.046,1.848,-0.405,-0.328,2,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
countries like Germany and France are doing and he said that Muslims,-1.259,-0.713,-1.419,-1.331,0.122,-0.758,-0.8,-1.464,-0.941,-0.826,-0.983,-1.137,0.868,0.127,0.163,-0.006,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
issues and maybe combination is first of all for the safety issues like I see,-1.374,-1.253,-1.435,-1.285,-0.739,-0.763,-0.369,-1.609,-0.714,-0.511,-0.762,-0.946,0.26,0.545,2.269,-0.751,3,4,2,2,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
have or these away that there are more populous proportion of,-0.838,-0.74,-0.965,-1.186,1.564,1.269,0.596,-1.246,0.612,0.057,-0.747,-0.941,1.693,1.69,0.37,-0.536,4,3,1,1,1,1,3,4,2,1,1,1
force or thing is the unemployment rate in Korea is like,-1.431,-1.182,-1.411,-1.233,-0.267,-0.734,-1.564,-0.928,-1.488,-1.484,-1.448,-1.277,-0.274,-0.712,-2.675,-1.864,3,4,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
obligation to take in refugees yeah then you agree that Korea has,-1.321,-1.286,-1.37,-1.329,-0.872,-0.625,-2.067,-1.7,-1.394,-1.603,-1.282,-1.336,-0.527,-0.568,-1.845,-1.914,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1

boundary if we look this into small boundary I think we can compare it with,-1.129,-1.463,-1.278,-1.168,0.252,-0.46,-0.403,-1.836,-1.097,-1.306,-1.178,-0.976,0.673,2.217,0.995,-1.148,2,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
as I mean not a lot but then there's still help me it's increased from the form,-1.475,-0.703,-1.37,-1.363,-0.105,-0.661,-0.716,-1.733,-0.881,-1.002,-1.282,-1.073,-0.135,-0.691,-0.47,-1.529,3,3,1,2,1,2,3,3,2,1,1,1

of course Northeast Asia as a German South Korea North Korea General is very in stable place in the political,-1.426,-1.052,-1.299,-1.097,-0.102,-0.56,-0.17,-1.385,-1.311,-1.074,-0.922,-1.258,1.547,2.719,-0.628,-0.342,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,1,2,1
refugees or maybe a huge portion of them like what happened now has,0.113,-1.093,-0.737,-1.009,0.469,0.422,1.654,-1.055,-1.608,-1.541,-1.453,-1.36,-0.548,-0.762,-3.046,-2.017,4,3,1,2,1,1,3,2,1,1,1,1
at not accepting the loss in Europe but try to force Islam,-1.413,-1.368,-1.46,-1.34,-0.098,-0.142,-0.821,-1.604,-1.721,-1.656,-1.434,-1.447,-1.083,-1.12,-2.832,-2.107,2,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1

so yeah Korea should take care of their Nationals as well,-1.575,-1.344,-1.446,-1.316,-0.254,-0.64,-1.51,-1.833,-1.293,-0.84,-1.047,-1.17,1.445,0.742,-0.27,-0.794,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
but I don't know about any water or religious problems,-1.375,-1.403,-1.465,-1.294,-0.829,-1.21,-1.356,-1.807,-1.388,-1.34,-1.067,-1.183,0.729,0.262,-1.191,-1.423,3,4,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,2,1
like strictly against this refugees right so talking about that then,-1.532,-1.47,-1.56,-1.386,-0.853,-1.126,-2.724,-1.811,-1.606,-0.957,-1.417,-1.252,-0.73,0.019,-1.699,-1.403,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,3,1
is some car like they call hit or humanitarians humanitarian visas,-1.601,-1.522,-1.539,-1.424,-0.944,-1.02,-0.256,-1.798,-1.67,-1.631,-1.55,-1.412,-0.766,-0.843,-1.798,-1.956,4,3,1,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
high levels of youth unemployment so there is this concept of this idea that,-1.668,-1.546,-1.587,-1.417,-1.085,-1.164,-2.689,-1.935,-1.365,-1.176,-1.325,-1.392,-0.367,-0.888,-1.905,-1.815,3,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
you have to accept that I think,-0.552,-0.796,-0.408,-0.959,-0.703,-0.81,0.127,-0.563,-1.288,-1.182,-1.409,-1.269,-0.454,-0.434,0.223,-1.534,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
okay that's the same that not a lot of people know,-1.496,-1.475,-1.415,-1.348,-0.112,-0.528,-2.179,-1.76,-1.473,-1.507,-1.412,-1.075,0.979,-0.47,-2.18,-1.869,3,4,2,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
that these refugees can get into and therefore don't have space for these people,-1.574,-1.446,-1.527,-1.335,-0.552,-0.962,-2.439,-1.873,-1.485,-1.357,-1.433,-1.232,0.011,-0.411,-1.861,-1.651,3,3,1,2,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
you know if South Korea chooses to like lock the refugees,-0.643,-0.457,-1.269,-1.07,-0.56,-0.9,1.06,-0.94,-0.979,-1.024,-1.354,-1.155,-0.366,-0.195,0.59,-1.472,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,3,1
is very hypocritical and against the words that Korea should be keeping it with International,-1.621,-1.618,-1.369,-1.435,-0.895,-0.948,-2.258,-2.03,-1.552,-1.472,-1.562,-1.293,-0.546,-0.916,-1.826,-1.623,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
he stopped the war and reject money III read that money to the yemeni citizens,-0.076,-0.696,-0.364,-0.762,3.792,2.521,0.658,-1.16,-1.483,-1.03,-1.408,-0.999,0.474,0.387,-1.2,-1.458,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
areas of different reasons about the threats well we redo,-0.213,1.785,-0.065,-0.318,-0.464,0.115,0.381,-0.345,-1.212,-0.931,-1.435,-1.316,-0.251,-0.53,-1.807,-1.591,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
it's wrong and that this is the natural reaction of the people in Korea,-1.025,-0.722,-0.375,-0.727,-0.478,-0.873,-0.632,-0.832,-1.485,-1.521,-1.31,-1.328,-0.399,-0.4,-0.708,-1.538,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
I think I have an idea of where you were going and to be honest Muslims,-1.672,-1.565,-1.501,-1.333,-0.651,-0.878,-2.596,-1.947,-1.146,-0.503,-1.184,-1.034,0.796,0.924,0.209,-0.546,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
second point is multiculturalism I agree with that,-1.339,-1.053,-1.29,-1.305,-0.294,-0.444,-1.257,-1.298,-1.533,-1.519,-1.123,-1.364,-1.139,-1.109,-1.58,-1.064,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
in Japan so and many other like European countries it's mostly the middle,-1.407,-1.336,-1.367,-1.181,-0.453,-0.778,-1.843,-1.576,-1.461,-1.298,-1.361,-1.326,-0.023,-0.276,-0.341,-1.538,3,4,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,2,1
I think the government isn't doing enough to help the disabled,-0.991,-0.893,-1.283,-1.204,1.571,0.083,0.193,-1.24,-1.294,-0.314,-1.215,-1.065,2.276,0.846,-1.345,-0.742,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,4,2,1,1,1
also it is built it is believed that it is believed,-1.229,-1.276,-1.212,-1.163,1.111,0.334,0.7,-0.974,-1.553,-1.385,-1.153,-1.349,-0.3,-0.935,-2.046,-1.678,4,2,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
South Korea is fully capable of accepting yemenis refugees I would like to,-0.301,0.153,-0.883,-0.794,3.231,2.038,-0.14,0.961,-1.316,-0.705,-1.165,-1.221,2.25,1.042,-1.379,-0.546,3,3,1,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
would agree with you maybe you came would have a better welfare situation,-1.392,-1.144,-1.418,-1.232,-0.658,-0.626,-1.132,-1.518,-1.568,-1.4,-1.266,-1.293,0.138,-0.086,-0.64,-1.683,2,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
social confusion so I think those kind of confusion will be even much,0.084,2.139,-1.017,-0.527,3.367,2.596,-0.159,0.735,-1.35,-1.342,-1.281,-1.274,-0.487,-0.317,-2.345,-1.916,4,3,1,1,2,1,4,3,1,1,2,1
then that much that much money has to be taken from,-0.617,0.691,-0.855,-1.205,8.096,3.063,-0.663,-1.211,-1.71,-1.625,-1.622,-1.468,-1.009,-1.311,-2.45,-2.032,2,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
Refugee studies International Convention I think Korea has a duty to take part in the global,-1.428,-1.381,-1.492,-1.263,-0.584,-1.045,-1.015,-1.147,1.144,-0.01,-0.399,-0.618,1.975,1.44,0.56,0.575,2,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,2,1
the LOL it's maybe their own motivation that they lost so that they can't find a job they can't take,-1.578,-1.43,-1.552,-1.331,-0.811,-1.034,-0.926,-1.634,-1.315,-1.159,-1.384,-1.244,-0.045,0.162,-0.752,-1.494,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
people into the community so that should be the first assignment in Korean government and,-1.452,-1.08,-1.469,-1.312,-0.59,-0.917,-1.524,-1.739,-1.075,-1.017,-1.32,-1.102,-0.602,-0.783,0.399,-1.783,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
our economy is stabilized with there's less chaos but the crisis isn't going to wait for us,-1.33,-1.217,-0.703,-1.052,1.333,3.047,-0.886,-0.687,-1.361,-1.453,-1.462,-1.112,-0.624,-0.559,-1.372,-1.739,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,2,1,1
unlike many of the other Asian countries that did not sign it and I think it's very important,-1.232,-1.18,-1.406,-1.281,1.052,-0.001,-0.87,-1.876,-1.459,-1.363,-1.514,-1.365,-0.592,-0.968,-0.748,-1.511,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
says I said there should be like some other ways,-1.471,-1.433,-1.336,-1.303,0.152,-0.4,-1.867,-1.507,-1.51,-1.277,-1.423,-1.216,-0.571,-1.046,-0.191,-1.772,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,3,1
but like Kpop for example there are a lot of fans in the other,-1.649,-1.137,-1.503,-1.37,-0.356,-0.96,-1.795,-1.616,-1.024,-1.28,-1.066,-0.769,0.488,-0.219,1.105,-1.509,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,3,1
so before but then Korea accepted them before going through like,-1.561,-1.447,-1.428,-1.332,-0.82,-0.855,-2.807,-1.986,-0.848,-0.293,-0.945,-0.977,0.487,1.127,-1.438,-1.164,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,1,1
shares argued that South Korea is to hormones homogeneous and many people face,-1.294,-1.298,-1.335,-1.118,-0.712,-0.796,-0.765,-1.219,-1.588,-1.459,-1.443,-1.384,-0.655,-0.542,-2.006,-2.021,4,3,1,2,1,1,3,2,1,1,1,1
government also consider walls of the South Korean citizens and,-1.576,-1.199,-1.422,-1.414,-0.37,-0.228,-0.141,-1.749,-0.699,-0.936,-1.104,-0.955,1.721,0.49,-0.446,-1.195,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,3,1
is not really compatible with Korean culture and they,-0.983,-0.647,-1.363,-1.317,0.849,-0.391,-1.687,-1.904,0.14,0.512,-0.937,-0.822,1.98,-0.556,-1.948,-1.624,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,1,2,1
now is bringing a lot of terrorism and fights within the state of Europe,-1.457,-1.505,-1.34,-1.046,-0.158,0.09,0.302,-1.404,-1.17,-1.268,-1.264,-1.121,-0.385,-0.421,-1.124,-1.374,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,2,1,1,1
a state of war in Korea it and Korean men are upload jacket military and,-1.056,-0.778,-1.171,-1.097,1.829,0.794,1.248,-0.256,-0.819,0.609,-0.036,-0.801,3.837,6.957,2.04,-0.637,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
so that they can stay in more legally without using the sides,-1.324,-0.997,-1.479,-1.232,-0.201,-0.541,-1.411,-1.408,-0.988,-1.289,-1.289,-1.077,-0.29,-0.26,-0.257,-0.872,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,2,1
but would it be good to take in children,-0.231,-0.618,-0.872,-0.776,4.558,1.637,0.477,0.037,-1.509,-1.396,-1.444,-1.319,-0.504,-0.523,-2.804,-1.621,2,3,2,1,1,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
somewhere else and I think that that money can be,-1.345,-0.984,-1.228,-1.183,1.636,0.611,-0.16,-1.349,-1.694,-1.598,-1.612,-1.452,-1.063,-1.274,-2.368,-2.074,3,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
agree we do in in a sense that since we have already signed their confession,0.633,-0.517,-0.954,-0.661,-0.303,-0.643,0.465,0.53,-1.332,-0.328,-0.848,-0.323,1.56,0.599,0.139,-0.415,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
part of Korea and certainly we can therefore conclude that the effect of refugees and Korean,-0.256,-0.327,-1.292,-1.111,1.418,1.01,0.112,-0.178,-1.009,-1.109,-1.321,-1.193,-0.387,-0.571,-0.055,-0.765,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
stuff but by experience for example in,-1.359,-1.351,-1.402,-1.242,0.321,-0.15,-0.705,-1.564,-1.009,-1.209,-0.887,-0.97,-0.714,-0.345,-1.49,-1.556,2,3,2,1,1,1,2,3,2,1,2,1

will live in a resort area I think people might avoid that area,0.176,0.081,-0.197,-0.408,3.013,2.086,2.15,-0.75,-1.667,-1.625,-1.513,-1.433,-1.086,-1.278,-2.064,-1.988,2,3,2,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1

to let immigrants in but for example Korea don't have any kind of those connections,-1.484,-1.206,-1.503,-1.193,0.399,-0.097,-0.919,-1.686,-1.481,-1.356,-1.455,-1.379,-0.517,-1.012,-2.778,-1.802,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,4,1,1,1,1
have any friends but I think I mean they still have,-0.727,-1.185,-1.245,-1.266,1.045,0.647,-0.49,-0.834,-1.468,-1.523,-1.531,-1.379,-0.593,-0.971,-3.021,-2.004,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,3,1,1,2
and that will be a huge problem and at that time,-1.633,-1.648,-1.629,-1.434,-0.929,-1.164,-2.934,-2.047,-1.422,-1.27,-1.081,-1.237,1.095,-0.875,-1.5,-1.689,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1

and also a rash decision that shouldn't be made so quickly,-1.318,-0.894,-1.335,-1.283,0.112,-0.686,-1.117,-1.237,-1.584,-1.251,-1.49,-1.354,-0.528,-0.956,-2.094,-1.771,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,1,1

Confucius countries which make our court ending or core culture,-1.303,-0.749,-0.672,-0.962,2.226,1.772,-0.365,-0.294,0.604,2.075,1.433,1.004,7.195,7.351,-1.155,1.039,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
well you have said that French,-1.266,-1.348,-1.53,-1.264,-0.308,-0.708,-0.288,-1.579,-1.553,-1.129,-1.257,-1.101,0.826,-0.265,-1.594,-1.295,2,4,1,1,1,1,3,4,1,1,1,1
because nowadays because of the war the infinite,-1.65,-1.547,-1.463,-1.406,-0.059,-0.565,-1.823,-1.863,-1.328,-0.321,-1.357,-1.209,0.51,-0.079,-1.275,-0.897,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
that you mentioned about rate,-0.587,-0.164,-0.668,-0.354,-0.21,-0.582,-0.843,-0.331,-0.959,-1.071,-1.036,-1.006,0.061,-0.202,-0.985,-1.371,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
hike in the eighth in the number of refugees from 42 seeking Asylum,-1.238,-1.147,-1.309,-1.231,0.263,-0.482,-1.216,-1.151,-0.49,-0.768,-0.968,-1.051,1.596,1.269,-0.671,0.836,3,3,1,2,2,1,4,4,2,1,1,1
it's like you say Korean government has put the human to the result,-1.518,-1.403,-1.402,-1.305,-0.187,-0.515,-1.191,-1.749,-1.434,-1.512,-1.481,-1.364,-0.176,-0.261,-1.654,-1.839,4,4,2,1,3,1,3,4,2,1,2,1
as a developed country,-1.392,-1.373,-1.276,-1.319,-0.889,-0.981,-2.174,-1.91,-1.42,-1.302,-1.241,-1.105,0.694,0.299,0.559,-1.398,4,3,1,2,1,1,3,2,1,1,1,1
and I'm too and you mean I think that race question because the some Koreans,0.111,-0.233,-1.077,-0.682,0.158,0.282,0.734,-0.463,-1.184,-1.501,-1.201,-1.211,1.379,0.878,-1.556,-0.768,4,3,1,1,1,1,4,4,2,1,2,1
that there are not like enough like shelter and like system systems I can,-1.441,-1.493,-1.51,-1.307,-0.896,-1.176,-2.175,-1.888,-1.431,-1.161,-1.457,-1.349,-0.466,-0.976,-1.227,-1.653,3,3,2,2,2,1,2,3,1,1,1,2
definitely understand why people would prefer to spend more tax money on,-1.63,-1.408,-1.469,-1.329,-0.689,-1.034,-1.907,-1.719,-1.565,-1.499,-1.477,-1.238,-0.499,-0.925,-1.608,-1.473,4,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
and it should be up to occur it shouldn't be applicable to now because as you can see,-1.508,-1.299,-1.303,-1.316,-0.303,0.013,-0.961,-1.741,0.694,0.734,-0.284,0.831,5.564,3.309,-0.28,0.65,4,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,2,1
and I just don't think that that's the first thing that we should focus on it's,-0.336,-0.435,-0.905,-1.003,2.041,3.182,1.235,-0.938,-1.52,-1.267,-1.514,-1.328,-0.886,-1.199,-1.309,-1.528,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
monitoring efforts and I think we should also be very careful,-1.012,-1.071,-1.037,-1.106,0.161,-0.094,-1.498,-1.234,-1.697,-1.609,-1.615,-1.446,-1.054,-1.249,-2.692,-2.013,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1

that those people in Jeju Island they fear about those know like,-1.278,-0.634,-1.441,-1.247,0.009,-0.716,-0.708,-1.324,-1.388,-1.389,-1.508,-1.358,-0.905,-0.91,-0.737,-1.203,3,4,2,2,2,1,2,3,1,1,2,1
these days you know all over the world we're talking about globalism,-1.507,-1.482,-1.532,-1.372,-0.845,-1.131,-2.29,-1.926,-0.618,-0.181,-0.869,-1.08,0.934,0.634,0.313,0.312,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
system that lets in these refugees so if the articles,-0.87,-0.884,-0.999,-1.097,1.748,1.971,0.841,-1.205,-1.662,-1.4,-1.559,-1.425,-0.793,-1.042,-2.5,-1.645,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
the government needs to help them more and I'm you said that extreme people add,-1.504,-1.401,-1.455,-1.342,-0.425,-0.198,-2.024,-1.671,-1.468,-1.335,-1.172,-1.253,0.856,0.076,-2.064,-1.638,4,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,1,1

paying people for but then the thing is even that has become a problem,-1.548,-1.427,-1.405,-1.259,-0.237,-0.527,-2.491,-1.775,-1.283,-0.667,-1.436,-1.267,0.064,-0.355,-1.089,-1.27,3,4,1,2,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1

okay,-0.931,-0.754,-0.335,-0.965,-0.746,-0.458,0.179,-0.578,-0.726,0.169,-0.859,-0.588,1.27,1.17,0.636,-0.162,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
food tastes like but for the,-1.395,-1.229,-1.364,-1.329,0.198,-0.272,-1.292,-1.76,-1.59,-1.598,-0.414,-1.364,-0.323,-0.426,-3.0,-2.067,3,3,2,1,1,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
typical typical Refugee like using SMS and Facebook,-1.463,-1.247,-1.47,-1.343,-0.452,-0.72,-0.506,-1.324,-1.496,-1.427,-1.278,-1.364,-0.597,-0.69,-2.509,-1.734,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,1,2,1
high countries other countries but you have to take into account that the GP,-1.076,-0.649,-0.981,-0.967,2.78,0.208,-0.463,-0.902,-1.678,-1.436,-1.461,-1.382,-0.648,-1.015,-2.439,-1.726,3,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
so on the matter on the matter of taking refugees from Yemen to Jeju Island on the,-1.405,-1.21,-1.365,-1.262,0.079,-0.035,-1.929,-1.836,-0.822,-0.98,-1.293,-1.187,0.985,0.67,0.335,-1.093,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
for the case of the yemenis refugees seeing this Mass influx especially,-1.458,-1.376,-1.487,-1.29,-0.571,-0.849,-0.996,-1.552,-1.532,-1.301,-1.45,-1.375,-0.76,-0.511,-1.668,-1.752,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,1,1
for now everything is sort of drastic and too soon for Koreans to actually come up with,-1.496,-1.366,-1.458,-1.361,-0.037,-0.596,-2.921,-1.741,-1.144,-0.977,-1.448,-1.157,0.043,-0.628,-1.406,-1.073,2,3,1,2,1,1,3,3,1,2,1,1
people in might be the case for some people that,-1.261,-0.907,-1.178,-1.033,0.892,0.615,0.455,0.119,-1.302,-1.204,-1.326,-1.187,-0.002,-0.746,-1.395,-1.526,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
that we read are accurate it does seem that this current system is very inefficient and does have major flaws,-0.637,-0.952,-1.159,-1.022,0.839,2.563,-1.294,-0.4,-1.712,-1.6,-1.605,-1.452,-1.021,-1.212,-2.87,-2.017,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
remain in Yemen they should do military they should do,-1.716,-1.613,-1.616,-1.426,-0.755,-1.117,-2.95,-1.97,-1.038,-1.141,-1.105,-0.786,-0.611,-0.407,-0.521,-0.927,3,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
it's time for Korean government to understand did what would you,0.451,3.364,2.753,0.832,11.17,7.699,0.205,0.585,-1.442,-1.004,-1.243,-1.281,-0.654,-0.969,-1.413,-1.315,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
Dimension,-1.093,-0.617,-1.147,-1.087,2.593,0.893,0.494,-0.79,-1.102,-1.073,-1.112,-0.927,-0.415,-0.351,-1.53,-1.716,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,4,1,2,1,1
and I think the fact that the younger generation is focusing on their own I guess survival,-0.542,-0.722,-1.144,-1.167,0.943,0.15,0.728,-1.004,-1.631,-1.539,-1.567,-1.383,-0.92,-1.067,-3.018,-1.985,4,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
so it would be bad for the economy of Jeju Island but,-1.561,-1.525,-1.49,-1.367,-0.41,-0.473,-3.028,-2.07,-1.347,-0.856,-1.167,-1.103,-0.186,0.367,0.317,-1.422,2,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
places like Yemen so this could happen to us too so there,-0.784,-1.253,-1.385,-1.027,-0.088,0.71,-1.334,-1.035,-0.883,-0.547,-1.104,-0.867,-0.481,-0.277,0.911,-1.231,4,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
security security of locals and with respect to refugees coming,-1.286,-1.187,-1.402,-1.235,-0.908,-1.095,-1.06,-1.727,-1.52,-0.838,-1.076,-1.264,1.357,0.327,0.973,-1.122,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,3,1
that they are they want to they want help from Korea and they want to contribute,-1.477,-1.48,-1.558,-1.417,-0.943,-1.037,-2.154,-1.781,0.085,0.259,-0.074,-0.56,8.655,7.875,2.213,-0.511,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
to an eight point eight percent so that really means that young people are having a hard time finding jobs,-1.329,-0.854,-1.386,-1.125,-0.48,-0.507,-0.954,-1.047,-1.517,-1.483,-1.445,-1.372,0.574,-0.517,-1.285,-1.608,3,4,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1

more difficult than for example in France most of the people that went on there,-1.635,-1.409,-1.414,-1.367,0.372,-0.294,-0.489,-1.505,-1.699,-1.525,-1.528,-1.395,-0.639,-0.633,-2.05,-1.956,3,4,2,2,2,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
I'll just okay,-1.485,-1.228,-1.408,-1.355,-0.69,0.276,-1.091,-1.776,-1.424,-1.168,-1.345,-1.304,-0.498,-0.581,-2.109,-1.499,2,2,2,2,1,1,3,2,2,1,3,1
doesn't guarantee safety so I think it's you can just,-1.319,-0.21,-1.216,-1.097,1.447,0.608,0.078,-0.38,-0.873,-1.048,-1.234,-0.677,0.057,0.536,-0.959,-1.288,3,3,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,1,1,2
think there is responsibility for Korea to Lieutenant,-1.484,-0.792,-1.347,-1.256,1.369,-0.339,0.801,-0.748,-1.189,-1.537,-1.404,-1.224,-0.155,-0.892,-2.197,-1.802,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,4,1,1,1,1

should put Korean people first and there are diminished I heard that there,-1.594,-1.231,-1.534,-1.336,-0.781,-1.208,-2.214,-1.831,-1.341,-1.305,-1.438,-1.293,-0.154,-0.64,0.13,-1.745,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1

Island and also although Korea is a default developed,-1.44,-1.263,-1.461,-1.361,-0.562,-0.954,-2.473,-1.701,-1.362,-1.495,-1.415,-1.219,-0.526,-0.922,-2.405,-1.595,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,4,2,1,1,1
in the middle income class and,-1.616,-1.403,-1.594,-1.403,-1.048,-1.272,-2.379,-1.895,-1.568,-1.515,-1.481,-1.196,-0.427,-0.595,-2.421,-1.597,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
stay in this country even though we actually made it into law that we could take them,-1.281,-1.265,-1.476,-1.254,-0.793,-0.843,-2.018,-1.846,-1.312,-1.302,-1.35,-1.293,-0.337,-0.484,-1.06,-1.085,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
Germany it's not like Germany and Israel and so but they are accepting the refugees,-1.721,-1.558,-1.645,-1.453,-1.189,-1.323,-2.636,-1.993,-0.69,0.123,-0.752,-0.118,1.871,1.431,-1.013,-0.204,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
I guess your prediction right that's TRUE,-1.392,-1.329,-1.231,-1.272,0.657,-0.349,-0.65,-1.736,-1.325,-1.32,-1.19,-1.148,1.258,0.068,-2.156,-1.816,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,1,1
new source is that an ombre known in Korea is a problem,-1.28,-1.058,-1.288,-1.137,0.847,-0.395,-0.783,-0.822,-1.674,-1.572,-1.542,-1.422,-0.752,-1.076,-2.813,-2.013,4,4,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
and the Korean population I believe that further education and some campaigning,-1.176,-0.582,-1.173,-1.211,-0.391,-0.429,-0.944,-1.09,-0.701,-0.206,-0.728,-1.047,2.322,1.377,1.075,-0.595,3,3,1,2,1,1,4,3,1,1,2,1
it's not comparable to the money Bushland but the thing is if you put on a ratio,-1.384,-1.176,-1.227,-1.196,0.635,-0.282,-0.68,-1.358,-1.183,-1.023,-1.358,-1.048,0.098,0.296,-2.037,-1.121,3,3,2,2,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
but they re they yeah at first they tried to do this job but they insisted that the,-0.897,-1.29,-1.373,-1.322,0.928,-0.059,-2.0,-1.371,-1.467,-1.566,-1.485,-1.375,-0.627,-0.992,-1.735,-1.971,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
but,-1.618,-1.504,-1.549,-1.391,-0.618,-0.748,-2.4,-1.952,-1.444,-0.858,-1.412,-1.266,0.245,-0.131,-1.308,-1.026,3,3,3,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
as an Evidence you showed the petition that number of the petitioners in foreign,-1.131,-1.029,-1.174,-0.681,-0.476,-0.924,-1.253,-1.199,-1.324,-0.914,-1.3,-1.179,0.04,0.121,-0.034,-1.017,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
lacks that I think that this kind of problem happens inside yeah well besides,-0.266,-0.361,-0.633,-0.106,-0.45,-0.67,-0.365,-1.322,-0.655,-0.649,-0.743,-0.743,3.133,2.377,0.505,-0.013,4,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
and developed country like there is like almost a double-double,-1.369,-1.106,-1.022,-1.22,1.004,0.387,-1.482,-1.036,-1.297,-0.767,-0.976,-0.93,0.372,0.036,-1.289,-1.298,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,4,2,1,1,1
for a trial at the court to let them into can stay for additional 90 days and,-0.58,-1.211,-1.215,-1.152,2.334,1.611,-0.835,-1.33,0.011,-1.292,-1.026,-0.846,0.708,0.138,0.031,-0.263,3,2,1,1,1,1,2,4,1,1,1,1
those people there so yeah I think it's for,-1.439,-1.393,-1.415,-1.358,-0.321,-0.679,-1.307,-1.745,-1.559,-1.495,-1.467,-1.351,-0.861,-1.071,-2.449,-1.815,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
chance and for a second second chance they got refugees from the euro,-1.195,-1.167,-1.374,-1.046,-0.03,0.128,-0.736,-1.236,-0.92,-0.922,-1.174,-1.135,-0.364,-0.747,-1.188,-1.294,2,2,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
Global there it doesn't it's not a global agreement between all these countries therefore,-1.572,-1.533,-1.533,-1.374,-0.42,-0.712,-2.553,-1.843,-1.02,-0.496,-1.137,-1.079,0.916,-0.398,-0.633,-1.4,3,3,2,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
to accept people of different ethnic diversity,-1.457,-1.375,-1.497,-1.303,-0.873,-1.1,-2.157,-1.888,-1.021,-0.993,-0.781,-1.275,1.41,0.758,0.785,-1.023,3,2,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
Korea has it's a big eyes development very quickly I would say after Korean War however if,-1.26,-1.114,-0.941,-1.121,1.982,0.858,-1.485,-1.511,-1.394,-1.426,-1.436,-1.241,-0.421,-0.691,-1.568,-1.446,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
be cautious in these what could be a greater issue in the future,-1.275,-1.215,-1.339,-1.301,0.038,-0.41,-1.073,-1.446,-1.394,-1.035,-1.3,-1.028,0.0,-0.52,-1.919,-1.189,2,2,2,1,1,1,3,2,1,1,3,2
Korean citizens life security and I think also is like the Privacy also,-1.338,-1.187,-1.398,-1.089,0.058,-0.275,-0.798,-1.239,-1.427,-1.131,-1.002,-1.218,1.054,0.145,0.396,0.006,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
is not really,-0.163,-0.413,-0.314,-1.162,2.498,0.987,1.403,-1.21,-1.354,-1.375,-1.48,-1.278,-0.463,-0.694,-1.276,-1.703,2,3,1,1,2,1,4,3,1,1,1,1

we need to filter out based on some evidence and,-1.564,-1.466,-1.424,-1.339,-0.044,-0.448,-2.41,-1.801,-1.519,-1.217,-1.418,-1.272,-0.478,-0.828,-1.834,-1.404,3,2,1,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,3,1

that is a nation that that focuses on,-1.364,-1.055,-1.455,-1.236,-0.563,-0.631,-0.984,-1.378,-1.469,-1.311,-1.455,-1.364,-0.718,-0.807,-2.586,-1.891,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
morale and I like not lights,-1.32,-1.133,-1.082,-1.239,-0.243,-0.338,0.03,-0.389,-1.424,-1.291,-1.44,-1.238,0.004,-0.36,-1.299,-1.329,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1

majority I don't think that they will attract to Jim and foot because it's not worldwide,-1.505,-1.241,-1.424,-1.314,-0.29,-0.798,-2.69,-1.891,-1.537,-1.447,-0.612,-1.325,-0.514,-0.633,-2.597,-1.904,2,3,2,1,1,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
okay so I think one of the major cons of,-1.16,-1.251,-1.343,-1.066,-0.561,-0.005,-1.105,-0.838,-1.29,-1.046,-1.486,-1.029,0.055,-0.248,-1.275,-1.633,2,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
the safeness of Corey as a whole,-1.219,-1.082,-1.266,-1.249,1.076,0.387,-1.983,-1.127,-1.372,-1.435,-0.994,-1.257,-0.213,0.036,-2.003,-1.666,2,4,2,1,1,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
are from like those Arab or like near Arab countries,-1.559,-1.024,-0.942,-1.258,-0.176,-0.543,-0.969,-1.527,-1.118,-1.405,-1.304,-0.83,0.225,-0.609,0.308,-1.571,2,2,1,1,2,1,3,4,1,1,3,1

so yeah I heard your points,-1.083,-0.389,-1.26,-0.967,1.225,0.593,-0.449,-0.538,-1.546,-1.441,-1.51,-1.346,-0.314,-0.751,-2.943,-1.968,2,2,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
about for European cases but for a career it's less than thousand and and I believe,-1.132,-1.203,-1.536,-1.287,-0.548,-0.645,-1.191,-1.4,-1.371,-1.253,-1.355,-1.028,-0.508,-0.438,-0.43,-1.238,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,4,1,1,1,1
they're more reluctant to accepting these people so it's hard to say is,-0.097,-0.831,-0.743,-0.93,-0.428,-0.901,-1.395,-0.907,-1.545,-1.464,-1.224,-1.304,0.347,-0.359,-2.4,-1.926,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
accept the refugees and therefore the law is not the issue if they're abusing the law we can change the law,-1.437,-0.803,-1.373,-1.275,0.731,-0.417,-0.254,-1.32,-1.524,-1.154,-1.428,-1.334,-0.545,-1.104,-1.387,-1.761,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
or even our parents were children so,-1.263,-1.191,-1.134,-1.071,-0.156,-0.241,-1.842,-1.056,-1.367,-1.142,-1.369,-1.243,-0.182,-0.928,-0.041,-0.789,2,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
that will rise for migration I think it's important to note that,-1.513,-1.446,-1.477,-1.35,-0.501,-0.68,-1.034,-1.46,-1.692,-1.388,-1.52,-1.404,0.838,-0.674,-1.613,-1.829,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
so it should pay more attention and make sure that it does not own citizens,0.089,-0.575,0.301,0.386,0.563,0.765,0.701,-0.316,-1.551,-1.37,-1.493,-1.007,-0.942,-1.047,-2.632,-1.912,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
I think they have the responsibility to take in the refugees SL pasta,-1.3,-0.986,-1.175,-1.085,0.753,0.514,-0.027,-0.487,-1.526,-1.464,-1.469,-1.348,-0.7,-0.857,-1.419,-1.697,3,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
there and continue living like this so it would be even,-0.903,-0.859,-1.31,-1.074,0.933,0.604,-1.1,-1.34,-0.711,-0.91,0.888,-0.657,5.237,11.599,-0.448,-0.73,3,3,2,1,1,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
Yemen refugees and they will be exposed to,-1.429,-1.44,-1.549,-1.301,-0.366,-0.997,-1.108,-1.915,-1.251,-0.664,-0.946,-1.269,1.113,-0.529,-0.915,-1.107,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
that means Yemen or Syria or something countries,-0.975,-0.476,-1.071,-1.27,1.853,1.496,-1.082,-1.066,-0.553,1.243,-0.544,-0.977,0.733,1.367,0.126,-0.334,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,2,2,1

for the Koreans it's hard to understand them and also,-1.377,-0.71,-1.444,-1.275,0.399,-0.401,0.289,-1.328,-1.475,-1.526,-1.548,-1.375,-0.807,-0.937,-1.89,-1.842,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,4,1,1,1,1

guarantee that they will lead career right,-1.328,-1.568,-1.328,-1.319,-0.12,-0.597,-1.152,-1.741,-1.618,-1.299,-1.443,-1.214,-0.488,-0.807,-1.318,-1.399,4,3,1,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
do the wrong things what legals illegals or how the government,-1.359,-1.346,-1.291,-1.258,0.495,0.136,-1.047,-1.756,-1.362,-1.397,-1.097,-1.215,1.264,-0.041,-1.722,-1.714,4,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
letting the enemies of Jesus Korea is this idea of Koreans come first so if,-1.553,-1.543,-1.552,-1.266,-0.788,-1.057,-1.762,-1.737,-0.554,-1.335,-1.206,-0.576,0.883,0.417,0.697,0.09,2,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
into the country with some restrictions and more over than that,-1.459,-1.317,-1.361,-1.311,-0.197,-0.332,-1.674,-1.532,-1.374,-1.412,-1.515,-1.304,-0.213,-0.708,1.421,-1.695,2,3,1,1,1,1,2,4,1,1,2,1
that can refute that and for safety issue,-1.566,-1.368,-1.409,-1.323,-0.09,-0.517,-2.758,-1.991,1.64,0.337,1.476,1.183,10.0,6.861,1.191,-0.109,2,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
it's packed that other nations who scientists fashion except ourselves,-0.101,-0.166,0.09,-0.659,-0.304,-0.445,1.272,-0.33,-1.504,-1.269,-1.56,-1.332,-0.752,-0.982,-2.526,-1.722,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
that the refugees are bringing on to the European societies and therefore the and objection will be,-0.586,-1.246,-1.268,-1.135,-0.041,-0.411,-0.346,-0.936,-0.806,-1.047,-1.178,-0.935,0.154,-0.285,-1.342,-1.154,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,4,1,1,1,1
all from those people from that country because Yemen they actually come from far,-1.596,-1.573,-1.547,-1.425,-1.021,-1.148,-1.194,-1.644,0.757,0.534,0.717,0.778,2.063,1.492,1.347,2.745,2,2,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
but yeah in that process those refugees,-0.921,-0.903,-0.766,-0.536,-0.734,-0.613,0.524,-0.696,-0.369,-0.698,-1.303,-1.168,-0.546,-1.0,-1.342,0.089,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
is directed straight from the public service cut,-1.205,-0.539,-1.062,-1.122,1.507,1.625,-0.269,-0.843,-1.321,-1.32,-1.468,-1.236,0.072,-0.45,-1.524,-1.189,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
yeah it's TRUE but that's because it does bi young Matt young male,-1.664,-1.579,-1.561,-1.435,-0.858,-1.158,-2.826,-1.983,-1.154,-0.876,-0.669,-0.983,1.007,-0.402,0.712,-0.677,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,3,1
for for example fishing jobs and cooking jobs which are individual,-1.483,-1.488,-1.562,-1.338,-0.53,-0.894,-2.275,-0.985,-1.656,-1.631,-1.596,-1.392,-0.861,-1.089,-3.063,-2.092,4,4,2,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
that is a good point on a human rights level the,-1.511,-1.523,-1.54,-1.369,-1.151,-1.208,-2.711,-1.857,-0.991,-1.195,-1.146,-1.013,1.531,0.62,1.589,-1.025,4,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,2,1,1,1
the feel like the looking,-1.368,-1.014,-1.337,-1.315,0.535,0.17,0.071,-1.403,-0.339,0.86,-1.041,0.242,0.05,-0.297,-0.878,-0.459,3,3,2,2,2,2,3,4,3,2,1,2
before but so I think this this is a,-1.401,-1.284,-1.381,-1.404,-0.576,-0.779,-1.844,-1.788,-0.871,-1.084,-1.324,-1.046,0.118,0.198,0.497,-1.422,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,4,2,1,2,1
exactly so I don't think it all but not all of them follow,-1.556,-1.385,-1.381,-1.155,-0.403,-0.042,-1.095,-1.638,-0.109,0.109,-0.565,-0.97,2.259,2.857,-0.278,-0.253,3,3,1,1,2,1,4,3,2,2,2,1
or office jobs they can relax labor employment,-1.381,-1.225,-1.407,-1.28,1.207,-0.397,-0.938,-1.655,-1.034,-0.99,-1.424,-1.138,-0.157,-0.903,-1.212,-1.239,3,3,2,1,3,1,3,3,2,2,2,2
the major blood I think the whole question of you,-1.368,-1.177,-1.336,-1.241,0.358,-0.101,-0.93,-0.614,-1.455,-1.407,-1.482,-1.247,-0.674,-1.059,-0.458,-1.782,3,4,1,2,1,2,3,3,2,1,1,1
so fly you know like like this government you'll provide the you know you're at they,-1.415,-1.315,-1.325,-1.259,0.436,0.065,-0.436,-1.434,-1.048,-0.955,-1.324,-1.091,0.162,-0.672,1.103,-1.148,3,3,2,2,2,2,3,4,3,1,2,2
prioritize what human life but I'm wondering if whether that priority should extend,-0.854,-0.909,-0.843,-0.609,3.805,2.386,-0.152,-0.616,-1.71,-1.556,-1.632,-1.446,-1.127,-1.273,-2.745,-1.9,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
and I think the statistics show this so,-1.261,-1.242,-0.904,-1.041,2.439,0.131,-0.665,-1.479,-1.507,-1.14,-1.512,-1.309,-0.974,-1.181,-1.742,-1.686,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
countries which mentioned like Germany which I understand is in a different situation but even so it is still very small,-1.594,-1.382,-1.409,-1.333,-0.267,-0.49,-2.416,-2.008,-1.309,-1.107,-1.403,-1.113,0.02,-0.624,-1.146,-1.55,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
sure with enough intent the government would be flexible enough to allocate,-0.575,-0.342,-1.041,-1.024,4.152,0.48,-1.152,-0.2,-0.933,-1.099,-1.294,-1.069,-0.003,0.36,-0.698,-0.97,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
I agree with you with that okay Korean just side of convention in 1991,-1.458,-1.56,-1.406,-1.325,-0.638,-0.788,-2.829,-1.91,-1.331,-1.009,-1.054,-1.164,0.473,-0.349,-0.096,-0.637,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,4,2,1,1,1
how not ready we are as a country to let in these refugees,-1.261,-0.75,-1.056,-0.966,0.989,1.401,0.648,-0.802,-1.687,-1.441,-1.612,-1.442,-0.865,-1.129,-2.709,-1.826,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
it doesn't it doesn't guarantee that if this country only consists of,-0.95,-0.951,-1.322,-1.278,0.944,0.065,-0.117,-0.618,-1.14,-0.396,-1.405,-1.336,0.707,0.463,-1.325,-1.323,3,3,2,2,2,1,3,3,2,2,2,2
yeah I don't I don't think there's enough Wells for Korean government to support,-0.981,-0.932,-1.267,-1.101,1.061,0.078,0.626,-0.979,-1.523,-1.324,-1.399,-1.226,-0.047,-0.2,-2.805,-1.844,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
I just put,-1.503,-1.461,-1.487,-1.282,-0.645,-0.718,-2.03,-1.729,-1.589,-1.44,-1.285,-1.218,-0.188,-0.279,-1.884,-1.509,4,4,2,1,3,1,3,4,2,1,2,1
off these people giving these who came to this country came here basically,-0.986,-0.668,-1.145,-0.902,1.63,-0.182,0.357,-0.777,-1.385,-1.478,-1.38,-1.293,-0.524,-0.746,-2.797,-1.777,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
and I think we should recognize the like,-1.23,-1.235,-1.26,-1.253,0.384,-0.039,-0.863,-0.25,-1.51,-1.528,-1.456,-1.314,-0.733,-0.791,-2.771,-1.848,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
I really strongly recommend would think that those,-0.525,-0.93,-0.835,-0.585,1.085,0.98,-0.369,-0.21,-1.358,-0.679,-1.492,-1.229,-0.516,-0.92,-0.589,-1.65,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
around other than just appeal to them briefly for just for political sake first,-1.432,-0.832,-1.199,-1.293,0.613,0.245,-1.256,-0.536,-1.701,-1.118,-1.448,-1.363,-0.465,-0.85,-1.225,-1.399,3,3,2,1,1,1,4,3,2,1,2,1
you look at the statistics the majority of the people who are against the Emmys,-1.432,-0.646,-1.347,-1.186,0.145,-0.571,-2.403,-1.249,-1.57,-1.404,-1.461,-1.164,-0.561,-0.553,-2.028,-1.827,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
the meaning of refugee is that they have some problems in their country they,-1.415,-0.409,-1.401,-1.281,0.37,-0.309,-1.319,-1.287,-1.484,-1.524,-1.443,-1.376,-0.547,-0.975,-0.861,-1.7,4,3,2,2,2,1,2,3,2,1,1,1
that there was a Facebook group consisted of like 150 Yemen,-1.255,-0.524,-1.107,-1.159,0.994,0.25,2.114,-1.077,-0.748,-0.851,-1.345,-1.284,1.007,-0.003,-1.516,-1.369,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
with the idea of a lot of other cultures coming in especially as you've mentioned and regeneration but if there,-1.382,-1.286,-1.338,-1.25,-0.013,-0.077,-2.737,-1.947,-1.071,-1.22,-1.275,-1.199,0.734,0.663,0.417,-0.985,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
any government that's that's involved in some kind of,-0.961,-1.275,-1.214,-1.244,0.977,0.624,0.459,-1.621,-0.81,-1.265,-1.312,-1.115,0.151,-0.149,-0.86,-1.72,2,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,1,1
money on them when we should be focusing on other important issues that are more relevant to,-1.213,-1.045,-1.265,-1.26,0.116,-0.506,-0.734,-1.316,-1.309,-1.373,-1.383,-1.341,-0.408,-0.982,-2.505,-1.896,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
system is not suitable ooh for receiving the profusion I don't,-1.493,-0.878,-1.19,-1.107,0.669,-0.209,-1.107,-1.413,2.405,0.404,5.286,2.444,9.612,10.245,-0.125,0.587,4,3,1,1,3,1,3,2,1,1,2,1
here I partly agree with your idea and it's,-1.259,-1.252,-1.36,-1.145,-0.098,-0.669,-0.144,-1.462,-0.135,0.338,-0.371,-0.834,2.296,1.269,0.519,0.847,3,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
and early the people amount of people of them is really low like 0.02 percent so it will not affect,-0.844,-1.321,-1.403,-1.071,-0.494,-0.716,-2.569,-1.856,-1.274,-0.944,-1.478,-1.349,-0.75,-1.082,-0.666,-1.245,2,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
I agree and like youth problems their unemployment they're big but the current issue,-1.537,-1.415,-1.485,-1.287,-1.077,-1.248,-1.93,-1.722,-1.387,-1.363,-1.35,-1.22,-0.263,-0.728,-1.753,-1.019,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
we repeat the point that there was a sudden increase of from 41,0.241,-0.578,1.411,-0.712,-0.554,-0.088,1.282,0.718,-1.363,-1.645,-1.495,-1.204,-0.854,-1.197,-1.148,-1.924,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
some aren't some are getting a good education but some are we the education at have,0.439,1.938,-0.187,-0.677,8.559,6.232,1.137,0.366,-1.242,-1.376,-1.087,-1.159,-0.148,0.368,-1.841,-1.418,2,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
because right now the Yemen refugees are only about 500 and it's not,-1.337,-0.232,-1.088,-0.853,0.683,0.352,-0.237,0.225,-1.207,-1.111,-1.209,-1.088,0.741,-0.157,1.821,-1.404,2,3,1,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
begin to not generalize the certain people,-1.616,-1.267,-1.602,-1.385,-0.865,-1.118,-2.755,-2.004,-1.228,-0.881,-1.319,-1.181,-0.338,-0.452,0.201,-0.694,3,2,2,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,3,1
aware of this issue and since back in 1994 over,0.808,0.988,1.631,1.238,-0.309,0.273,-0.021,2.309,-1.503,-1.487,-1.476,-1.259,-0.845,-0.756,-2.848,-1.753,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
North Korea is not luck now the homogeneous flow Theory anymore Priyanka I have had receiving,-1.29,-1.328,-1.195,-1.14,0.454,0.08,-0.726,-1.312,-0.612,1.027,-0.442,-0.521,0.857,1.489,1.667,-0.269,3,2,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,2,2,1
and it's it's rather an obligation that they stayed here,-1.372,-1.144,-1.436,-1.369,-0.252,-0.181,-0.301,-1.117,-1.491,-1.215,-1.329,-1.29,-0.478,-0.659,-0.617,-1.405,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
from the littlest which make their core religion is,-1.384,-1.336,-0.946,-1.283,0.867,0.515,-1.97,-1.476,1.389,2.904,1.033,0.5,10.166,5.89,0.566,0.173,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
agreeing to it or accepting it already seven hundred thousand people signed a petition to the blue house,-0.307,-0.288,0.014,-0.511,-0.406,0.018,-0.292,0.097,-0.883,-1.471,-1.297,-1.165,-0.758,-0.814,-1.266,-1.647,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
of bed but then the thing is it's still there and then in the EU you,-1.275,-0.574,-1.385,-1.184,-0.244,-0.098,-1.619,-1.28,-1.17,-0.58,-1.195,-1.107,0.407,-0.082,-0.501,-1.213,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,4,3,1,1,1
in stable Nation considering the war between North Korea and South Korea Korea is in,-0.53,-0.953,-1.3,-0.691,-0.089,-0.41,-0.47,-1.636,-1.183,-1.241,-0.786,-1.185,3.457,1.945,-1.041,-0.646,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
things in your rug but it does mean it hasn't occurred in Korea,-1.722,-1.607,-1.583,-1.414,-1.038,-1.252,-2.627,-2.026,-0.545,-0.206,-0.466,-0.777,7.047,0.202,-0.542,-0.695,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,1,3,1
so that's one of the main points that you could say that they don't do it like that,-1.651,-1.582,-1.615,-1.43,-0.679,-0.993,-2.642,-1.898,-0.733,-0.24,-0.929,-1.098,1.969,1.998,0.333,-0.914,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
about the things that can guarantee their life this is what I want,-1.339,-1.157,-0.934,-1.272,0.265,0.315,-1.197,-1.722,-1.628,-1.397,-1.497,-1.373,-0.19,-0.857,-1.553,-1.886,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
I think it's important to take care of the Korean Nationals first and,-1.212,-0.686,-1.034,-1.233,0.827,-0.257,-0.346,-0.874,-0.768,-1.388,-0.962,-1.067,2.242,2.604,-0.459,0.294,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1

countries there are other countries who are able to accept the refugees and,0.046,-0.725,-0.645,-0.592,3.57,2.393,1.374,-0.112,-1.299,-1.222,-1.539,-1.372,-0.621,-0.97,-0.75,-1.711,3,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
in general I am against accepting those that position,-1.267,-1.243,-0.692,-0.898,3.391,4.815,-0.846,-1.073,-1.246,-0.226,-1.276,-1.247,0.805,-0.163,-0.711,-0.818,3,3,2,2,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
risk for for arriving to South Korea and putting them back,-1.521,-0.849,-1.367,-1.216,-0.485,-0.566,-0.474,-1.567,-1.26,-1.417,-1.188,-1.263,0.267,-0.52,-1.272,-0.648,4,3,1,2,1,1,3,2,1,1,1,1

a trend towards a political extremism in terms of this issue that,-1.288,-1.463,-0.759,-1.241,0.872,0.893,-1.387,-1.259,-1.532,-1.556,-1.546,-1.422,-0.755,-0.802,-2.386,-1.895,3,3,2,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
one of the main reason that I disagree with accepting refugees is that,-1.087,-1.178,-1.223,-1.077,0.021,-0.864,-0.927,-1.177,-1.576,-1.45,-1.275,-1.376,0.037,-0.589,-0.588,-1.775,3,4,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,2,1
it starts not when you make me did you know how USA become the strongest country,0.207,-1.197,-0.108,-0.816,0.608,0.826,-0.651,0.869,-1.074,-0.727,-1.162,-1.003,0.213,0.959,-0.193,-1.331,2,2,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
as if there's only invading the mainland and it's very easy for us to contain them,-1.422,-1.179,-1.37,-1.348,0.068,-0.711,-1.329,-1.589,-1.57,-1.541,-1.569,-1.397,-0.848,-1.17,-1.986,-1.633,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
on baseless misconceptions that we Muslims are potential terrorists,-1.153,-0.999,-1.305,-1.174,0.935,0.671,-0.167,-0.604,-1.654,-1.528,-1.541,-1.406,-0.873,-0.924,-2.802,-1.916,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
to take refugees I think we should really have to see what what what,-0.931,-0.847,-0.897,-1.096,2.221,1.96,-1.468,-0.539,-1.341,-1.377,-1.392,-1.272,-0.224,-0.26,-1.769,-1.509,2,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
and also they this,-1.62,-1.603,-1.585,-1.415,-0.956,-1.042,-1.483,-1.766,-1.411,-1.154,-1.215,-1.222,0.233,0.579,-1.311,-1.541,3,4,1,1,2,1,4,4,2,1,1,1

are political factions including the tug of Americans that encourages,-0.652,1.258,0.038,-0.895,5.84,3.515,0.087,0.049,-1.466,-1.139,-1.469,-1.125,-0.666,-0.976,-0.955,-1.77,2,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
raise the question I think it will be good things,-0.993,-1.497,-1.145,-1.161,0.054,0.221,-1.238,-1.717,-1.506,-1.458,-1.308,-1.321,0.836,0.265,-2.797,-1.94,4,3,1,1,1,1,3,4,2,1,2,1
the bad people would come to Korea do,-1.187,-1.182,-1.172,-1.21,0.363,0.283,-1.561,-1.4,-1.434,-0.879,-1.014,-1.221,-0.181,0.197,0.63,-1.65,2,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
society and just because creating some creating Nationals are poor that's not the fault,-1.608,-1.523,-1.494,-1.361,-0.664,-1.049,-2.822,-1.978,-0.794,-0.243,-1.095,-0.857,1.277,1.506,0.106,-1.134,3,3,2,1,1,1,4,4,2,1,2,1
of maybe 500 refugees and over those 500,-1.098,-1.09,-1.288,-1.245,0.886,0.703,-1.159,-1.174,-1.517,-1.467,-1.566,-1.43,-0.732,-1.045,-2.924,-1.935,4,4,2,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
I would and those people could cause as you have mentioned,-1.424,-1.248,-1.223,-1.212,-0.018,-0.162,-1.266,-0.435,-1.501,-1.398,-1.6,-1.412,-1.027,-1.219,-0.998,-1.717,3,3,2,2,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
first these refugees came,-0.671,-0.706,-0.65,-0.869,2.792,3.8,2.029,-0.741,-1.632,-1.566,-1.491,-1.416,-0.755,-1.104,-2.526,-1.932,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
3% and then the young adult unemployment rate is shoots up,-1.613,-1.54,-1.478,-1.347,-0.55,-0.834,-2.684,-1.958,-1.067,-0.487,-1.054,-0.946,1.617,0.338,-0.593,-0.986,3,4,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
are not respecting those and I would think that it's,-1.549,-1.359,-1.407,-1.197,0.339,0.022,-0.819,-1.512,-1.524,-1.537,-1.449,-1.39,-0.201,-0.519,-1.835,-2.048,3,3,2,2,2,1,3,3,3,1,1,1
from the perspective of the Korean citizen in might be a better idea I can,-1.261,-0.923,-1.298,-1.256,1.036,1.191,-1.313,-1.493,-1.32,-1.42,-1.447,-1.312,-0.494,-0.761,-2.557,-1.816,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
it's also important to mention that I think it is also part of government,-1.519,-1.318,-1.34,-1.311,-0.564,-0.882,-2.141,-1.924,-1.438,-1.259,-1.363,-1.07,-0.334,-0.101,-2.045,-1.792,4,3,2,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
and now it now pour the Korea the other countries Iraq,-1.161,-1.269,-1.194,-1.094,0.232,0.357,2.098,-1.205,-1.1,2.136,-0.706,-0.921,0.91,-0.264,0.005,-0.504,3,3,1,2,2,1,3,3,1,2,2,1
it's so far from Yemen but it's so far from Yemen so,-1.675,-1.59,-1.583,-1.454,-1.012,-1.197,-2.591,-2.053,-1.184,-1.154,-0.908,-1.336,-0.358,-0.685,-1.591,-1.681,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,1,2,1
have a stereotypical Prejudice of Outsiders to to like they're going to,-1.548,-1.442,-1.335,-1.307,0.366,0.015,0.218,-1.669,-1.384,-1.396,-1.372,-1.321,0.211,0.06,-0.82,-1.247,3,3,3,2,2,2,3,2,3,2,1,2
but Yemen is Refugee Heaven,-1.362,-1.485,-1.498,-1.24,-0.888,-1.067,-0.311,-1.792,-1.563,-1.43,-1.296,-1.361,-0.865,-1.087,-2.948,-1.924,4,4,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
and think of Koreans for,-1.348,-1.172,-1.356,-1.274,0.387,-0.14,-2.515,-1.676,-1.524,-1.449,-1.528,-1.414,-1.144,-1.264,-0.418,-1.836,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,4,1,2,1,1
so I also think that,-1.323,-1.374,-1.169,-0.611,2.091,0.241,-0.781,-1.638,-1.097,-1.461,-1.487,-1.288,-1.017,-1.026,-0.993,-1.593,3,2,1,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
