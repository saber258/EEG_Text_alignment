do have an obligation to fairly examine and if they are lawful but if you have,95,2,2,0,0,1,0,95,2,2,0,0,1,0,-0.912,0.606,-0.242,-0.326,-0.355,-0.583,0.541,0.704,-0.881,-0.828,-1.221,-0.973,0.675,0.687,-1.451,-1.39
to accept it,100,2,2,1,0,0,0,100,2,2,0,0,1,0,0.46,2.481,3.927,0.705,2.114,1.92,0.735,3.051,-0.341,-0.703,-0.728,-0.672,1.707,1.063,-1.693,-0.567
yeah so,105,2,2,0,0,0,0,105,2,2,0,0,1,0,0.496,-0.49,0.896,0.025,1.308,0.788,0.646,-0.755,-1.475,-1.219,-1.482,-1.305,-0.541,-0.857,-2.146,-1.536
overall I like against this accepting the refugees,110,1,2,0,0,0,0,110,2,2,0,0,1,0,0.782,-0.199,-0.018,0.112,-0.008,-0.523,-0.184,-0.998,-1.356,-1.375,-1.552,-1.29,-0.819,-1.075,-2.553,-1.924
currently in Jeju largely because a lot of the population is not,115,2,2,0,0,0,0,115,2,2,0,0,1,0,0.659,-0.938,-0.014,0.728,-0.173,-0.159,2.437,-0.661,-1.59,-1.489,-1.573,-1.317,-0.965,-1.125,-2.651,-1.809
agreeing to it or accepting it already seven hundred thousand people signed a petition to the blue house,120,2,2,0,0,0,0,120,2,2,0,0,1,0,-0.307,-0.288,0.014,-0.511,-0.406,0.018,-0.292,0.097,-0.883,-1.471,-1.297,-1.165,-0.758,-0.814,-1.266,-1.647
against accepting the refugees and,125,2,2,0,0,0,0,125,2,2,0,0,1,0,-0.308,-0.988,-0.424,0.381,-0.273,-0.417,-0.033,-0.565,-1.274,-1.204,-1.298,-1.155,-0.42,-0.451,-2.813,-1.474
the difference I guess when you're talking about xenophobia is,130,2,2,0,0,0,0,130,2,2,0,0,1,0,-0.38,-0.795,-0.426,-0.212,-0.42,-0.199,-1.339,0.608,-1.674,-1.625,-1.613,-1.414,-0.906,-1.203,-2.945,-1.996
there already 2 million foreigners leave living illegally in Korea right now,135,2,2,0,0,0,0,135,2,2,0,0,1,0,0.469,1.588,0.48,0.674,-0.414,0.374,0.665,-0.765,-1.463,-1.561,-1.416,-1.37,-0.575,-0.599,-2.901,-2.057
the reason people are against it would be more because these people,140,2,2,0,0,0,0,140,2,2,0,0,1,0,0.57,-0.157,0.628,0.835,-0.185,0.283,0.603,0.351,-1.613,-1.54,-1.52,-1.412,-0.654,-1.111,-1.691,-1.692
without visas cannot be accounted for but their actions the country itself because it seems such,145,2,2,0,0,0,0,145,2,2,0,0,1,0,6.672,0.218,3.446,2.547,0.471,3.042,-0.975,-0.06,-1.314,-1.449,-1.164,-1.183,-0.728,0.115,-2.427,-1.868
turmoil it cannot take responsibility for these people therefore,150,2,2,0,0,1,0,150,2,2,1,0,1,0,1.132,0.002,0.685,0.567,0.407,-0.191,-0.528,0.641,-1.399,-1.467,-0.839,-1.255,0.295,-0.321,-2.295,-1.322
they're more reluctant to accepting these people so it's hard to say is,155,2,2,0,0,1,0,155,2,2,0,0,1,0,-0.097,-0.831,-0.743,-0.93,-0.428,-0.901,-1.395,-0.907,-1.545,-1.464,-1.224,-1.304,0.347,-0.359,-2.4,-1.926
racist or xenophobia data to and this,160,2,2,0,0,1,0,160,2,2,0,0,1,0,-0.863,-0.94,-0.549,0.066,-0.178,-0.472,0.397,0.351,-1.506,-1.359,-1.474,-1.173,-0.465,-0.87,-1.159,-1.726
there's this General lack of trust of the Korean government especially for the young,165,2,2,0,0,1,0,165,2,2,0,0,1,0,-0.634,-0.893,0.464,0.144,-0.49,-0.1,-0.976,-1.127,-0.89,-1.006,-1.138,-0.887,0.938,-0.08,-0.267,-1.049
adults that the Korean government is not particular of its own citizens,170,2,2,0,0,1,0,170,2,2,0,0,0,0,0.336,-0.411,0.934,-0.244,-0.146,-0.284,-0.693,-0.509,-1.532,-1.52,-1.358,-1.247,-0.785,-1.022,-2.048,-1.855
so it should pay more attention and make sure that it does not own citizens,175,2,2,0,0,1,0,175,2,2,0,0,0,0,0.089,-0.575,0.301,0.386,0.563,0.765,0.701,-0.316,-1.551,-1.37,-1.493,-1.007,-0.942,-1.047,-2.632,-1.912
don't feel that the treatment towards refugees are unfair compared to the people,180,2,2,0,0,1,0,180,2,2,0,0,0,0,1.166,-0.138,0.153,0.478,1.769,2.135,1.603,1.037,-1.428,-1.33,-1.518,-1.33,-0.501,-0.85,-2.868,-1.951

I'll just okay,305,1,1,1,1,0,0,305,2,1,1,0,2,0,-1.485,-1.228,-1.408,-1.355,-0.69,0.276,-1.091,-1.776,-1.424,-1.168,-1.345,-1.304,-0.498,-0.581,-2.109,-1.499
so talking about proof that's very important of course we don't have any proof,310,2,1,1,1,0,0,310,2,1,0,0,2,1,-1.238,-0.514,-1.164,-1.073,-0.01,0.113,-1.926,-1.216,-1.352,-1.303,-1.424,-1.395,-1.009,-1.002,-1.517,-1.557
that they will do something they will commit a crime in Korea but,315,1,1,1,1,0,0,315,2,1,0,0,2,1,-1.32,-1.372,-1.341,-0.996,0.351,0.264,-1.184,-1.384,-1.533,-1.425,-1.542,-1.374,-1.047,-1.169,-1.408,-1.935
we should be more cautious from the beginning,320,1,1,1,1,0,0,320,2,1,0,0,2,1,-1.154,-0.334,-0.877,-0.827,0.728,0.158,-0.444,-0.515,-1.311,-0.843,-1.49,-1.134,-0.732,-0.91,-1.629,-1.535
before something happens so it's not bad think to,325,1,1,1,0,0,0,325,2,1,0,0,2,1,-1.562,-1.297,-1.453,-1.305,-0.496,-0.919,-0.341,-1.643,-1.436,-1.079,-1.448,-1.275,-0.904,-0.961,-1.627,-1.798
be cautious in these what could be a greater issue in the future,330,1,1,1,0,0,0,330,2,1,0,0,2,1,-1.275,-1.215,-1.339,-1.301,0.038,-0.41,-1.073,-1.446,-1.394,-1.035,-1.3,-1.028,0,-0.52,-1.919,-1.189
after the well then discard really takes place also,335,2,1,1,0,0,0,335,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.202,-0.924,-1.324,-1.165,0.21,-0.316,-0.173,-1.855,-1.063,-1.513,-1.481,-1.22,-0.902,-1.019,-2.35,-1.343
when upon accepting these refugees,340,2,1,1,0,0,0,340,2,2,1,0,1,0,-0.935,-1.187,-1.326,-1.138,0.291,0.427,-0.159,-1.517,-1.232,-1.026,-1.383,-1.231,-0.671,-0.832,-0.994,-1.551
much more refugees will try to come to Korea and,345,2,2,1,0,0,0,345,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.427,-1.463,-1.196,-1.188,0.541,-0.485,-0.176,-0.811,-1.168,-1.354,-1.466,-1.245,-0.789,-0.658,-1.754,-1.344
actually in case of Germany they have already experienced,350,2,2,1,0,0,0,350,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.425,-1.251,-1.385,-1.278,-0.525,-0.354,-1.411,-1.717,-1.07,-1.137,-1.417,-1.312,-0.752,-0.965,-0.802,-1.55
this issue and they they have accepted nearly like 1,355,2,2,1,0,0,0,355,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.223,-1.27,-1.248,-1.303,0.387,-0.107,-1.54,-1.598,-1.371,-1.504,-1.519,-1.32,-0.501,-1.046,-0.918,-1.498
million refugees already and they are causing social and economic,360,2,2,1,0,0,0,360,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.379,-0.856,-1.48,-1.392,-0.242,-0.582,-1.568,-1.633,-1.103,-1.098,-1.258,-1.199,-0.518,-0.736,-0.503,-0.646
problems so they already regret it,365,2,2,1,0,0,0,365,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.632,-1.429,-1.522,-1.379,-0.276,-0.943,-1.284,-1.743,-1.382,-1.301,-1.422,-1.235,-0.667,-0.905,-1.229,-1.486
but it's already it's already happened so they can't do anything about it,370,1,2,1,0,0,0,370,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.343,-1.146,-1.373,-1.188,0.177,-0.191,-0.914,-1.606,-1.548,-1.378,-1.501,-1.319,-0.592,-0.96,-2.167,-1.515
so thank talked about proof again,375,2,2,1,0,0,0,375,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.495,-1.242,-1.404,-1.333,0.235,-0.718,-2.151,-1.867,-1.331,-1.202,-1.212,-1.234,-0.397,-0.898,-0.248,-1.36
I really strongly recommend would think that those,380,2,2,1,0,0,0,380,2,2,1,0,1,0,-0.525,-0.93,-0.835,-0.585,1.085,0.98,-0.369,-0.21,-1.358,-0.679,-1.492,-1.229,-0.516,-0.92,-0.589,-1.65
refugees need to bring in their own proof that they are legitimate people,385,1,2,1,0,0,0,385,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.176,-1.192,-1.411,-1.338,-0.316,-0.751,-0.853,-1.739,-1.433,-1.372,-1.482,-1.273,-0.791,-0.786,-1.586,-1.624
who have been in your advice and issues and,390,1,2,1,0,0,0,390,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.384,-1.174,-1.388,-1.325,-0.432,-0.807,-1.274,-1.359,-0.88,-1.297,-1.299,-0.897,-0.225,-0.456,-1.392,-1.429
that they are they want to they want help from Korea and they want to contribute,395,2,2,1,0,0,0,395,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.477,-1.48,-1.558,-1.417,-0.943,-1.037,-2.154,-1.781,0.085,0.259,-0.074,-0.56,8.655,7.875,2.213,-0.511
to creating some way okay so you saying that there should be some way,400,1,2,1,0,0,0,400,2,2,0,0,2,0,-1.571,-1.433,-1.424,-1.295,-0.47,-0.958,-2.228,-1.566,-1.547,-1.331,-1.448,-1.254,-0.658,-0.557,-0.177,-1.725
to kind of filter on this like actual refugees right I also agree with the,405,1,2,1,0,0,0,405,2,2,0,0,2,0,-0.399,-0.907,-0.985,-0.603,1.117,1.169,0.793,-1.037,-1.239,-1.515,-1.45,-1.34,-0.277,-0.562,-0.592,-1.535
point like there should be some like strict regulation that actually built,410,1,2,1,0,0,0,410,2,2,0,0,2,0,-1.095,-0.575,-1.36,-1.14,-0.131,-0.114,-1.003,-0.078,-0.617,-1.331,-1.333,-1.185,-0.048,-0.274,2.048,-0.533
out for filters out those fake Ravens refugees but then,415,2,2,1,0,0,0,415,2,2,0,0,2,0,-1.511,-1.234,-1.507,-1.259,-0.05,-0.406,-2.428,-1.174,-1.085,-1.228,-1.32,-0.998,-0.253,-0.313,0.059,-1.115
you know the thing is that when you just,420,1,2,1,0,0,0,420,2,2,0,0,2,0,-1.133,-1.258,-1.293,-1.319,-0.402,-0.854,-1.641,-1.636,-0.655,-0.948,-1.378,-1.212,0.235,-0.374,-0.382,-0.736
so the main topic is about like being,425,1,2,1,0,0,0,425,2,2,0,0,2,0,-1.575,-1.344,-1.532,-1.278,-0.771,-1.107,-0.96,-1.7,-1.605,-1.17,-1.433,-1.251,-0.555,-0.907,-1.357,-1.148
like strictly against this refugees right so talking about that then,430,2,2,1,0,0,0,430,2,2,0,0,2,0,-1.532,-1.47,-1.56,-1.386,-0.853,-1.126,-2.724,-1.811,-1.606,-0.957,-1.417,-1.252,-0.73,0.019,-1.699,-1.403
says I said there should be like some other ways,435,2,2,1,0,0,0,435,2,2,0,0,2,0,-1.471,-1.433,-1.336,-1.303,0.152,-0.4,-1.867,-1.507,-1.51,-1.277,-1.423,-1.216,-0.571,-1.046,-0.191,-1.772
to sort out rather than just blocking all those refugees and,440,2,2,1,0,0,0,440,2,2,1,0,2,0,-1.652,-1.471,-1.571,-1.341,-1.082,-1.293,-2.589,-1.86,0.233,0.58,-0.779,-0.839,1.638,1.077,0.918,-1.03
if you do love all those refugees because you know they're from the are upside people and then there are a lot,445,2,2,1,0,0,0,445,2,2,1,0,2,0,-1.683,-1.45,-1.57,-1.389,-0.767,-1.008,-2.324,-1.808,-1.409,-1.432,-1.517,-1.347,-0.703,-0.895,-1.874,-1.666
of other foreigners who like these days,450,2,2,1,0,0,0,450,2,2,1,0,2,0,-1.504,-1.52,-1.481,-1.337,-0.952,-1.129,-0.887,-1.54,-1.343,-0.851,-1.336,-1.121,-0.402,-0.577,-0.136,-0.63
only if it's a good example,455,2,2,1,0,0,0,455,2,2,1,0,2,0,-1.58,-1.567,-1.532,-1.3,-0.844,-0.968,-2.138,-1.62,-1.474,-0.838,-1.298,-1.168,0.108,-0.429,-0.092,-0.812
but like Kpop for example there are a lot of fans in the other,460,2,2,1,0,0,0,460,2,2,1,0,2,0,-1.649,-1.137,-1.503,-1.37,-0.356,-0.96,-1.795,-1.616,-1.024,-1.28,-1.066,-0.769,0.488,-0.219,1.105,-1.509
this Asian side and even the oxide as well if we,465,2,2,1,0,0,0,465,2,2,1,0,2,0,-1.487,-1.393,-1.473,-1.031,-0.612,-1.022,-1.261,-0.654,-1.44,-1.382,-1.518,-1.393,-0.459,-0.954,-1.491,-1.747
you know if South Korea chooses to like lock the refugees,470,2,2,0,0,0,0,470,2,2,1,0,2,0,-0.643,-0.457,-1.269,-1.07,-0.56,-0.9,1.06,-0.94,-0.979,-1.024,-1.354,-1.155,-0.366,-0.195,0.59,-1.472
and then becomes like a global issue,475,1,2,0,0,0,0,475,2,2,1,0,2,0,-1.377,-1.178,-1.498,-1.288,-0.506,-0.754,-1.157,-1.596,-1.373,-1.289,-1.375,-1.35,-0.533,-0.672,-0.625,-1.471
in that sense you know it might affect Fame Alec,480,2,2,0,0,0,0,480,2,2,1,0,2,0,-1.486,-1.333,-1.419,-1.285,-0.281,-0.617,-2.02,-1.785,-1.526,-1.509,-1.502,-1.339,-0.709,-0.709,-0.487,-1.745
nothing but like reputation about Multicultural country,485,2,2,0,0,0,0,485,2,2,1,0,2,0,-1.397,-1.438,-1.265,-1.197,-0.039,-0.42,-1.649,-1.359,-1.256,-0.566,-1.35,-1.241,0.013,-0.255,-0.76,-1.756
like South Korea is becoming one of the Multicultural country and there are a lot of,490,2,2,0,0,0,0,490,2,2,1,0,2,0,-1.462,-0.999,-1.421,-1.336,-0.652,-1.037,-2.414,-1.517,2.035,0.586,-0.596,0.037,6.901,4.534,0.625,-0.897
exports the other countries as well so,495,1,2,0,0,0,0,495,2,2,1,0,2,0,-1.172,-1.065,-1.309,-1.266,-0.271,-0.229,-1.117,-1.697,-1.017,0.194,-1.116,-1.225,0.515,-0.149,-1.569,-0.106
maybe you could you know affect economic side it's hard,500,2,1,0,0,0,0,500,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.601,-1.242,-0.931,-0.953,0.946,0.3,-2.026,-0.981,-1.465,-1.013,-1.381,-1.217,0.618,-0.401,-1.059,-1.473
to wrap it up just saying that,505,2,1,0,0,0,0,505,2,2,1,0,2,0,-1.482,-0.857,-1.444,-1.226,0.099,-0.645,-1.865,-1.774,-1.312,-1.42,-1.444,-1.295,-0.356,-0.889,-1.66,-1.52
it's bad for okay okay so yes so you,510,2,1,0,0,0,0,510,2,2,1,0,2,0,-1.203,-1.131,-1.222,-1.208,-0.07,0.289,-0.339,-1.051,-1.277,-1.047,-1.404,-1.267,-0.556,-0.66,-1.498,-1.135
partly agree that we should not totally accept these button to filter,515,2,1,0,0,0,0,515,1,2,1,0,2,0,-1.295,-0.872,-1.191,-1.158,0.647,0.218,-1.038,-1.071,-1.032,-0.809,-1.21,-1.058,1.596,-0.44,0.478,0.043
out but totals blocking is wrong in that sense I agree,520,2,1,0,0,0,0,520,1,2,1,0,2,0,-1.134,-1.48,-1.312,-1.223,0.096,-0.049,-1.533,-1.563,-1.083,-1.117,-1.316,-1.186,0.596,-0.822,-1.221,-1.085
totally blocking is not right so that I said that,525,2,1,0,0,0,0,525,2,2,1,0,2,0,-1.586,-1.262,-1.488,-1.352,-0.105,-0.847,-2.294,-1.554,-1.141,-1.208,-1.372,-1.255,-0.637,-0.886,-1.094,-1.658
we need to filter out based on some evidence and,530,2,1,0,0,0,0,530,2,2,1,0,2,0,-1.564,-1.466,-1.424,-1.339,-0.044,-0.448,-2.41,-1.801,-1.519,-1.217,-1.418,-1.272,-0.478,-0.828,-1.834,-1.404
also like he talked about the image making image set image of Korea could be damaged by,535,2,1,0,0,0,0,535,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.47,-1.023,-1.33,-1.174,0.459,-0.559,-1.941,-1.125,-1.586,-1.359,-1.455,-1.255,-1.123,-1.136,-2.328,-1.771
total blocking of these refugees well yeah it could,540,2,1,0,0,0,0,540,2,2,1,0,1,0,-0.997,-1.084,-1.303,-1.293,-0.1,0.075,0.202,-1.577,-1.651,-1.048,-1.543,-1.354,-0.787,-1.12,-1.761,-1.518
so I also think that,545,2,1,0,0,0,0,545,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.323,-1.374,-1.169,-0.611,2.091,0.241,-0.781,-1.638,-1.097,-1.461,-1.487,-1.288,-1.017,-1.026,-0.993,-1.593
image is important but that's out,550,2,1,0,0,0,0,550,2,2,1,0,2,0,-1.43,-1.364,-1.515,-1.288,-0.548,-0.977,-0.587,-1.62,-1.084,-1.112,-1.404,-1.132,-0.613,-0.923,-0.042,-1.378
of Korea issue and I think me to take more care,555,2,1,0,0,0,0,555,2,2,1,0,2,0,-1.534,-1.554,-1.521,-1.375,-0.184,-0.903,-1.937,-1.759,-1.073,-1.539,-1.459,-1.23,-0.094,-0.63,-2.008,-1.762
of inside issues where we can really experience,560,2,1,0,0,0,0,560,2,2,1,1,1,0,-1.323,-1.434,-1.301,-1.341,-0.176,-0.688,-1.011,-1.866,-1.13,-1.428,-1.282,-1.032,-0.59,-0.72,-1.944,-1.576
some issues really closely maybe ourselves,565,1,2,0,0,1,0,565,1,2,1,0,1,0,-0.859,-1.166,-1.2,-1.306,1.797,-0.091,0.396,-0.955,-1.475,-1.155,-1.472,-1.34,-0.624,-0.832,-1.805,-1.483
or even our parents were children so,570,1,2,0,0,1,0,570,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.263,-1.191,-1.134,-1.071,-0.156,-0.241,-1.842,-1.056,-1.367,-1.142,-1.369,-1.243,-0.182,-0.928,-0.041,-0.789
okay so which I'm trying to argue against the yemeni refugees,5,2,2,1,0,1,0,5,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.66,-1.6,-1.534,-1.375,0.162,-0.933,-2.704,-2.031,-1.352,-1.538,-1.263,-1.17,0.732,0.093,-0.649,-1.523
coming hurry up and think the strongest point that I can make is practically speaking the,10,2,2,1,0,1,0,10,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.555,-1.385,-1.509,-1.302,-0.302,-0.759,-1.407,-1.799,-1.408,-0.12,-1.366,-1.119,0.624,0.077,-1.848,-1.624
resources high and South Korea is not big enough to take in any more foreigners and for labor force so,15,2,2,1,0,1,0,15,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.602,-1.17,-1.433,-1.221,-0.199,-0.641,-1.519,-1.508,-1.527,-1.513,-1.429,-1.395,0.468,-0.463,-2.206,-1.958
if they're coming for a tourist purpose they're actually being Spenders,20,2,2,1,0,1,0,20,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.55,-1.523,-1.434,-1.342,-0.402,-0.427,-2.699,-1.964,-1.473,-1.395,-1.353,-1.302,0.145,-0.699,-0.038,-1.537
their customers so they're actually increase resource pie with Korea,25,2,3,1,1,0,0,25,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.098,-1.347,-1.405,-1.188,-0.673,-0.982,-1.676,-1.404,-1.528,-1.322,-1.486,-1.323,-0.239,-0.714,-2.639,-1.542
but then the thing is these people are coming in as refugees he wants to be letting so labor,30,2,3,1,1,0,0,30,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.507,-1.559,-1.55,-1.4,-0.785,-1.009,-2.471,-1.915,-1.501,-1.411,-1.5,-1.286,-0.149,-0.693,-2.697,-1.91
force or thing is the unemployment rate in Korea is like,35,2,3,1,0,0,0,35,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.431,-1.182,-1.411,-1.233,-0.267,-0.734,-1.564,-0.928,-1.488,-1.484,-1.448,-1.277,-0.274,-0.712,-2.675,-1.864
3% and then the young adult unemployment rate is shoots up,40,2,3,1,0,0,0,40,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.613,-1.54,-1.478,-1.347,-0.55,-0.834,-2.684,-1.958,-1.067,-0.487,-1.054,-0.946,1.617,0.338,-0.593,-0.986
to an eight point eight percent so that really means that young people are having a hard time finding jobs,45,2,3,1,0,0,0,45,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.329,-0.854,-1.386,-1.125,-0.48,-0.507,-0.954,-1.047,-1.517,-1.483,-1.445,-1.372,0.574,-0.517,-1.285,-1.608
in other words I keep on going back to the point saying we don't have a large in a resource,50,2,2,0,0,0,0,50,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.36,-1.298,-1.514,-1.387,-0.85,-1.003,-2.076,-1.98,-1.496,-1.556,-1.455,-1.315,-0.17,-0.697,-2.454,-1.959
so if we were to take in laborers,55,2,2,0,0,0,0,55,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.674,-1.617,-1.517,-1.402,-0.812,-0.979,-2.87,-2.074,-1.575,-0.68,-1.486,-1.294,-0.384,-0.42,-1.128,-1.529
we're sorting that I were taking away more of the pie which would even increase the crisis between,60,2,2,0,0,0,0,60,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.563,-1.411,-1.451,-1.324,-0.587,-0.857,-1.719,-1.831,-1.229,-0.841,-1.319,-1.165,0.698,0.243,-1.796,-1.416
young adults and the already employed labor force also then another point we can make,65,2,3,0,0,0,0,65,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.54,-1.181,-1.511,-1.266,-0.685,-0.837,-2.071,-1.754,-1.37,-0.754,-1.137,-0.847,0.175,0.306,0.651,-1.155
is these people are looking for cheaper or they are looking for these simple laborers,70,2,3,0,0,0,0,70,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.7,-1.617,-1.576,-1.376,-0.753,-1.008,-2.908,-2.065,-1.326,-1.122,-1.355,-1.215,0.773,-0.358,-1.832,-0.983
paying people for but then the thing is even that has become a problem,75,2,3,0,1,0,0,75,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.548,-1.427,-1.405,-1.259,-0.237,-0.527,-2.491,-1.775,-1.283,-0.667,-1.436,-1.267,0.064,-0.355,-1.089,-1.27
within the current government because the lowest possible,80,2,3,0,1,0,0,80,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.519,-1.295,-1.304,-1.321,-0.774,-0.056,-1.17,-1.451,-1.228,-1.321,-1.286,-1.331,-0.185,0.156,-2.273,-1.789
"wage the primary wage has gone up to almost 10,000",85,2,2,0,0,0,0,85,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.47,-1.531,-1.436,-1.313,-0.596,-0.899,-1.671,-1.992,-1.363,-1.301,-1.442,-1.289,0.676,-0.394,-1.768,-1.019
so a lot of young people are trying to get into these cheap laborers to if he,90,2,2,0,1,0,0,90,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.624,-1.501,-1.531,-1.376,-0.308,-0.792,-2.652,-1.949,-1.284,-1.458,-1.214,-1.271,-0.291,-0.047,-0.942,-1.64
stays in other words they're practically is no bottom fruits,95,2,2,0,1,0,0,95,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.387,-1.015,-1.477,-1.212,-0.631,-1.023,-0.62,-1.595,-1.601,-1.214,-1.434,-1.228,-0.031,-0.859,-1.414,-1.679
that these refugees can get into and therefore don't have space for these people,100,2,2,0,1,0,0,100,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.574,-1.446,-1.527,-1.335,-0.552,-0.962,-2.439,-1.873,-1.485,-1.357,-1.433,-1.232,0.011,-0.411,-1.861,-1.651
that's it for me so,105,2,2,0,1,0,0,105,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.577,-1.509,-1.52,-1.36,-0.429,-0.743,-2.444,-1.71,-1.445,-1.53,-1.46,-1.218,-0.062,-0.55,-1.98,-1.827
I think I'm gonna jump in right into what you just said and stuff so basically,110,2,2,0,1,0,0,110,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.462,-1.268,-1.415,-1.339,-0.43,-0.408,-2.58,-1.449,-1.286,-1.259,-1.381,-1.247,0.417,0.03,-1.349,-1.547
the main point which is taken into account in some,115,3,3,1,0,1,0,115,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.316,-1.31,-1.283,-1.265,1.221,0.344,-1.475,-1.619,-1.45,-1.372,-1.432,-1.308,0.546,-0.373,-1.645,-1.843
new source is that an ombre known in Korea is a problem,120,3,3,1,0,1,0,120,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.28,-1.058,-1.288,-1.137,0.847,-0.395,-0.783,-0.822,-1.674,-1.572,-1.542,-1.422,-0.752,-1.076,-2.813,-2.013
I would say that it's mostly TRUE but not really comparable to other developed,125,2,3,1,0,1,0,125,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.299,-1.034,-1.411,-1.342,-0.228,-0.269,-0.379,-1.826,-1.69,-1.317,-1.58,-1.421,-0.849,-1.147,-2.545,-1.763
countries such as most of the westerners country actually South Korea has one of the lowest unemployment,130,2,3,1,0,1,0,130,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.513,-1.142,-1.487,-1.323,0.45,-0.864,-0.214,-1.601,-1.571,-1.529,-1.562,-1.358,-0.775,-1.106,-2.874,-1.87
rate and it is to be considered that the unemployment rate is as you said a lot of manual,135,2,3,1,0,1,0,135,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.339,-1.434,-1.498,-1.347,-0.652,-0.684,-1.28,-1.694,-1.539,-1.617,-1.567,-1.412,-0.928,-1.114,-3.032,-2.092

mostly like talking about Jeju Island all the foreigners right so we're,145,2,2,1,0,1,0,145,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.46,-1.294,-1.5,-1.375,-0.153,-0.699,-2.444,-1.644,-1.543,-1.279,-1.531,-1.343,-0.614,-0.874,-2.061,-1.935
Romania talking about people that are escaping a crisis and what we can see is that,150,2,2,1,0,1,0,150,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.402,-1.089,-1.385,-1.072,1.839,0.164,-0.26,-1.042,-1.597,-1.448,-1.528,-1.41,-0.722,-1.051,-2.657,-1.643
on this seminar we have a lot of seminar mainly,155,2,2,1,0,1,0,155,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.502,-1.357,-1.498,-1.354,-0.389,-0.953,-2.013,-1.819,-1.655,-1.622,-1.506,-1.424,-0.54,-1.113,-3.034,-2.026
for for example fishing jobs and cooking jobs which are individual,160,3,3,1,0,1,0,160,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.483,-1.488,-1.562,-1.338,-0.53,-0.894,-2.275,-0.985,-1.656,-1.631,-1.596,-1.392,-0.861,-1.089,-3.063,-2.092
and cannot provide and for example like they have whole amount,165,2,3,1,0,1,0,165,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.338,-1.338,-1.362,-1.224,-0.167,-0.395,-1.283,-1.501,-1.701,-1.59,-1.544,-1.428,-0.747,-0.993,-2.469,-2.026
of maybe 500 refugees and over those 500,170,3,3,1,0,1,0,170,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.098,-1.09,-1.288,-1.245,0.886,0.703,-1.159,-1.174,-1.517,-1.467,-1.566,-1.43,-0.732,-1.045,-2.924,-1.935
refugees or they already are the same they are about 170,175,2,3,1,0,1,0,175,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.663,-1.583,-1.565,-1.415,-0.791,-1.015,-2.417,-1.865,-1.665,-1.563,-1.591,-1.433,-0.963,-1.173,-2.827,-1.994
170 jobs I think for fishing so there is I think there is definitely spots,180,2,3,1,0,1,0,180,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.483,-1.271,-1.406,-1.161,0.328,-0.151,-0.902,-0.336,-1.482,-1.574,-1.475,-1.363,-0.541,-0.67,-1.922,-1.692
for those jobs that are in are no longer taking because these drugs,185,3,3,1,0,1,0,185,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.398,-1.339,-1.397,-1.214,-0.058,-0.356,-0.028,-1.531,-1.634,-1.512,-1.529,-1.42,-0.736,-1.011,-2.771,-1.968
are Maybe longer way from Seoul for example and long away,190,3,3,1,0,1,0,190,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.107,-1.036,-1.312,-1.075,1.721,-0.09,-0.055,-1.259,-1.661,-1.553,-1.503,-1.358,-0.588,-0.888,-2.733,-1.906
from families and I think that it's more over something more,195,3,3,1,0,1,0,195,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.43,-1.148,-1.369,-1.311,0.095,-0.228,-1.147,-1.173,-1.607,-1.385,-1.555,-1.405,-0.663,-0.866,-2.381,-1.818
humanitarian than economics even if the economics is to take into account,200,2,3,1,0,1,0,200,1,2,0,0,1,0,-1.385,-1.422,-1.455,-1.273,-0.119,-0.504,-0.031,-1.509,-1.561,-1.341,-1.511,-1.4,-0.745,-1.121,-1.712,-1.632
and as I say I don't think economics is really fun,205,3,3,1,0,1,0,205,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.632,-1.291,-1.492,-1.297,-0.274,-0.422,-2.293,-1.87,-1.469,-1.07,-1.375,-1.26,0.007,-0.448,-2.167,-1.571
I'm really glad that you brought into other countries into point because when comparing these,210,3,3,1,0,1,0,210,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.557,-1.382,-1.421,-1.311,-0.281,-0.415,-0.379,-1.407,-1.406,-1.271,-1.35,-1.157,0.225,0.748,-1.135,-1.278
unemployment rates between countries it's also important to see what kind of humanitarian AIDS,215,3,3,1,0,1,0,215,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.322,-1.405,-1.484,-1.387,-0.202,-0.351,-1.061,-1.458,-1.539,-1.478,-1.374,-1.29,-0.056,-0.744,-1.491,-1.547

of bed but then the thing is it's still there and then in the EU you,240,2,2,0,0,1,0,240,2,3,2,0,0,0,-1.275,-0.574,-1.385,-1.184,-0.244,-0.098,-1.619,-1.28,-1.17,-0.58,-1.195,-1.107,0.407,-0.082,-0.501,-1.213
have these this inter connect enter Europe,245,2,2,1,0,1,0,245,2,3,2,0,0,0,-1.418,-1.355,-1.145,-1.295,-0.127,-0.559,-2.337,-1.825,-1.416,-1.489,-1.406,-0.82,-0.096,-0.061,-1.669,-1.546
human health policy that insures these people,250,2,2,1,0,1,0,250,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.586,-1.554,-1.485,-1.438,-0.024,-0.79,-2.815,-1.883,-1.364,-1.231,-1.345,-1.152,0.162,-0.371,-2.209,-1.551
how every other that's not really TRUE because unless you're actually a Korean citizen not,255,3,3,2,0,0,0,255,2,3,1,0,0,0,-1.444,-1.437,-1.509,-1.31,-0.311,-0.843,-1.4,-1.559,-1.565,-1.509,-1.387,-1.071,-0.214,-0.286,-2.436,-1.791
really getting all these three basic insurances so,260,3,3,1,0,0,0,260,3,3,1,0,1,0,-1.588,-1.511,-1.514,-1.268,-0.536,-0.843,-2.803,-1.769,-1.586,-1.339,-1.455,-1.099,-0.518,-0.327,-0.36,-1.821
these foreigners and although he's unemployed people they're not really getting insured,265,3,2,1,0,0,0,265,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.587,-1.565,-1.528,-1.303,-0.623,-0.956,-2.777,-1.94,-1.217,-0.921,-1.32,-1.009,0.025,-0.191,-0.5,-1.438
in Mattoon ways but you and that's because we don't have enough tax,270,3,2,0,1,0,0,270,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.636,-1.564,-1.483,-1.344,-0.717,-0.881,-2.951,-2.052,-1.383,-1.324,-1.19,-0.979,1.065,0.326,-2.67,-1.711
money if that's something that comes from the text and it's hard to ensure these people,275,2,2,0,1,0,0,275,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.63,-1.595,-1.518,-1.421,-0.649,-0.815,-2.69,-2.043,-1.122,-1.258,-1.101,-1.102,0.384,0.577,-2.586,-1.665
and then second novel like people escaping crisis well the humanitarian argument,280,2,2,0,1,0,0,280,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.531,-1.551,-1.405,-1.252,-0.534,-0.835,-2.318,-1.555,-1.162,-1.096,-1.099,-0.862,0.345,-0.112,-0.996,-1.295
yes you could make it but then I like to ask what kind of practical,285,2,2,0,1,0,0,285,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.553,-1.475,-1.539,-1.195,-0.474,-0.918,-2.06,-1.863,-1.316,-0.88,-1.061,-0.758,2.826,0.107,-0.373,-0.683
benefit doll is being humanitarian bring to the country,290,2,2,0,1,0,0,290,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.418,-1.059,-1.413,-1.242,-0.183,-0.566,-1.82,-1.544,-1.302,-0.506,-1.036,-1.177,1.864,0.436,-0.334,-0.572
so we can think of all the examples such as States bringing people from South America,295,2,2,0,0,0,0,295,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.484,-1.349,-1.368,-1.195,1.468,0.222,-0.25,-1.019,-1.489,-1.269,-1.149,-0.919,0.592,0.075,-1.869,-1.519
now they're dying that to and the reality European Refugee crisis which,300,2,2,0,0,0,0,300,1,2,1,0,0,0,-1.144,-0.924,-1.214,-1.095,1.58,0.621,-1.902,-1.244,-1.189,-1.243,-1.142,-0.879,0.442,-0.161,-1.603,-1.757
now is bringing a lot of terrorism and fights within the state of Europe,305,2,2,0,0,0,0,305,1,2,1,0,0,0,-1.457,-1.505,-1.34,-1.046,-0.158,0.09,0.302,-1.404,-1.17,-1.268,-1.264,-1.121,-0.385,-0.421,-1.124,-1.374
as I mean not a lot but then there's still help me it's increased from the form,310,2,2,0,1,0,1,310,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.475,-0.703,-1.37,-1.363,-0.105,-0.661,-0.716,-1.733,-0.881,-1.002,-1.282,-1.073,-0.135,-0.691,-0.47,-1.529
I would like,315,2,2,0,1,0,1,315,1,2,1,0,0,0,-1.338,-1.042,-1.239,-1.09,0.286,0.067,0.506,-1.013,-1.257,-0.751,-1.262,-1.178,-0.349,-0.62,-2.608,-1.796
to take them say the last part which is mostly the first construed,320,2,3,0,1,0,1,320,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.322,-0.995,-1.464,-1.136,0.616,-0.801,0.911,-1.162,-1.359,-1.27,-1.443,-1.196,-0.274,-0.742,-1.97,-1.764
the major blood I think the whole question of you,325,2,3,0,1,0,1,325,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.368,-1.177,-1.336,-1.241,0.358,-0.101,-0.93,-0.614,-1.455,-1.407,-1.482,-1.247,-0.674,-1.059,-0.458,-1.782
humanitarian needs more about what you want to be as a country and,330,2,2,0,1,1,1,330,2,2,1,0,1,0,-0.065,-0.311,-0.872,-0.894,3.02,4.567,0.204,0.06,-1.643,-1.568,-1.549,-1.428,-0.809,-1.013,-2.842,-1.914
what you want to represent as you go to more than adding and subtracting,335,2,2,0,1,1,1,335,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.263,-0.741,-1.259,-1.003,0.503,0.126,0.946,-0.944,-1.618,-1.589,-1.537,-1.389,-0.662,-0.872,-2.829,-2.033
numbers of Economics I would say like for example so,340,2,2,0,1,1,1,340,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.443,-1.481,-1.324,-1.314,0.38,-0.201,-1.051,-1.673,-0.229,-0.545,-1.174,-0.784,2.921,0.276,0.912,0.702
scary Simon lot of convention Accords just she,345,2,2,1,1,1,0,345,3,2,1,0,1,0,-1.155,-1.184,-1.293,-1.273,0.736,0.32,-1.383,-1.104,-1.609,-1.622,-1.52,-1.414,-0.583,-1.032,-2.991,-2.067
that the country's somehow bound to respect even if a lot of countries,350,2,2,1,1,1,0,350,3,2,2,0,0,0,-1.603,-1.391,-1.296,-1.261,0.926,-0.224,-0.802,-1.273,-1.45,-1.586,-1.509,-1.392,0.025,-0.644,-2.675,-1.931
are not respecting those and I would think that it's,355,2,2,1,1,1,0,355,2,2,2,0,0,0,-1.549,-1.359,-1.407,-1.197,0.339,0.022,-0.819,-1.512,-1.524,-1.537,-1.449,-1.39,-0.201,-0.519,-1.835,-2.048
a bit difficult to not being you mean humanitarian considering,360,2,2,1,1,1,0,360,2,2,2,0,0,0,-1.303,-0.913,-1.243,-1.038,1.796,1.528,-0.127,-1.079,-1.461,-1.568,-1.411,-1.37,-0.326,-0.598,-2.139,-1.559
Yemen position themselves to be our position because like for example people,365,2,2,1,1,1,0,365,2,2,2,0,0,0,-1.096,-0.423,-1.235,-0.906,0.675,-0.107,-0.56,0.02,-1.563,-1.389,-1.537,-1.347,-0.539,-0.955,-2.378,-1.821
in Yemen didn't choose to start in Yemen with their life right and so if,370,2,3,1,1,1,0,370,2,2,2,0,0,0,-1.443,-1.264,-1.426,-1.279,0.196,-0.378,-1.351,-1.552,-1.352,-1.402,-1.359,-1.236,0.093,-0.766,-2.04,-1.98
they would start to Korea they would have the Korean mushroom tea and everything that comes with it,375,2,3,1,1,1,0,375,2,1,1,0,0,0,-1.558,-1.379,-1.494,-1.383,-0.236,-0.861,-0.944,-1.771,-1.535,-1.442,-1.511,-1.352,-0.308,-0.721,-2.264,-1.638
so it's kind of Epic buyers to sing by on the numbers and the last,380,2,3,1,1,1,0,380,2,1,1,0,0,0,-1.488,-1.364,-1.293,-1.264,0.512,0.564,-0.838,-0.732,-1.509,-1.627,-1.47,-1.418,-0.589,-0.909,-2.916,-2.082
part is about comparing refugees for example even if Korea is not Dutch learn,385,2,3,1,1,1,0,385,2,1,1,0,0,0,-1.313,-0.824,-1.295,-1.297,1.419,1.174,-0.872,-1.081,-1.661,-1.514,-1.366,-1.38,-0.1,-0.623,-2.921,-2.008
and even if there's a lot of problem we're basically comparing something,390,2,3,1,1,1,0,390,2,1,1,0,0,0,-1.458,-1.503,-1.461,-1.364,-0.128,-0.395,-1.013,-1.686,-1.537,-1.406,-1.44,-1.389,-0.204,-0.672,-2.748,-1.862
that is not comparable I would say because it's for attention,395,2,3,1,1,1,0,395,2,1,1,0,0,0,-1.291,-1.033,-1.281,-1.276,0.735,0.913,-1.384,-1.666,-1.653,-1.635,-1.552,-1.423,-0.862,-1.205,-2.595,-2.012
is somewhere near 1 million people in people will get gems around for,400,2,3,1,1,1,0,400,2,1,1,0,0,0,-1.512,-1.281,-1.333,-1.227,0.832,-0.03,-1.52,-1.659,-1.438,-1.519,-1.4,-1.262,-0.264,-0.619,-1.794,-1.941
maybe 500 people so I would say in the last spoke about,405,2,3,1,1,1,0,405,2,1,1,0,0,0,-1.336,-0.956,-1.368,-1.332,0.348,-0.162,-0.82,-1.783,-1.585,-1.459,-1.394,-1.381,-0.218,-0.907,-2.306,-1.89
terrorism I guess it's a bit I'm a bit biased because I'm from Europe,410,2,3,1,1,1,0,410,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.191,-1.109,-1.308,-1.036,-0.054,-0.649,-0.812,-1.177,-1.115,-1.378,-1.455,-1.247,0.431,-0.375,-1.506,-1.399
but I would say that despite everything we can hear you,415,2,3,1,1,1,0,415,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.483,-1.431,-1.396,-1.283,0.308,-0.276,-2.088,-1.652,-1.561,-1.402,-1.321,-1.337,0.113,-0.423,-2.391,-1.479
let me see not TRUE 382 diversion so,420,2,3,1,1,1,0,420,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.66,-1.569,-1.462,-1.446,-0.442,-0.73,-2.253,-1.957,-1.545,-1.49,-1.433,-1.332,0.044,-0.389,-2.942,-2.029
people are not really feeling scared like they're not really feeling concerned the whole therapy,425,2,2,1,1,1,0,425,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.602,-1.348,-1.418,-1.388,-0.507,-0.284,-1.843,-1.92,-1.497,-1.369,-1.433,-1.304,-0.298,-0.563,-2.339,-1.727
thing and yeah they are concerned but the link between immigration and terrorism he's a bit,430,2,2,1,1,1,0,430,2,2,1,0,0,0,-0.712,-0.54,-1.074,-1.034,1.788,0.25,-0.374,-0.323,-1.637,-1.261,-1.438,-1.285,-0.676,-0.324,-2.052,-1.958
more difficult than for example in France most of the people that went on there,435,2,3,1,1,1,0,435,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.635,-1.409,-1.414,-1.367,0.372,-0.294,-0.489,-1.505,-1.699,-1.525,-1.528,-1.395,-0.639,-0.633,-2.05,-1.956
are parks was actually French people it's French national tea,440,2,3,1,1,1,0,440,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.551,-1.197,-1.386,-1.291,0.335,-0.267,-0.874,-1.486,-1.189,-1.331,-1.387,-1.214,0.18,-0.294,-2.308,-1.762
people so it's not the Yellowjackets I guess but then before that there were Terror,445,2,3,1,1,1,0,445,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.538,-1.284,-1.275,-1.226,0.613,-0.396,-2.293,-1.575,-1.497,-1.365,-1.378,-1.247,0.8,-0.443,-2.836,-1.933
isn't helped by jihadists sharing some sort of like,450,1,3,1,1,1,0,450,2,1,0,0,0,0,-1.597,-1.533,-1.437,-1.356,0.345,-0.304,-2.258,-1.857,-1.359,-1.339,-1.139,-1.089,0.34,0.052,-0.208,-1.331
super extreme Islam yeah Belinda in the u.s. you mean or,455,2,3,1,1,1,0,455,2,1,0,0,0,0,-1.719,-1.587,-1.365,-1.409,0.274,-0.554,-2.632,-1.838,-1.326,-1.139,-1.438,-1.266,-0.511,0.291,-2.281,-1.625
internally then they are all the terrorist act we had except,460,2,3,1,1,1,0,460,2,1,0,0,1,0,-1.639,-1.35,-1.352,-1.261,0.856,0.001,-2.545,-1.458,-1.305,-0.691,-1.254,-1.221,0.436,-0.272,-1.489,-1.191
one or two were done by people that aren't French or Belgian nationality,465,2,3,1,1,1,0,465,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.607,-1.499,-1.496,-1.363,0.011,-0.398,-2.353,-1.836,-1.236,-1.434,-1.381,-1.062,-0.157,-0.486,-2.586,-1.874
okay that's the same that not a lot of people know,470,2,3,1,1,1,0,470,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.496,-1.475,-1.415,-1.348,-0.112,-0.528,-2.179,-1.76,-1.473,-1.507,-1.412,-1.075,0.979,-0.47,-2.18,-1.869
which is like there's,475,2,3,1,1,1,0,475,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.585,-1.457,-1.495,-1.319,0.11,-0.427,-2.182,-1.78,-1.132,-1.161,-1.145,-0.917,-0.081,1.064,-0.586,-1.554
a un from acts that several countries that you don't take in refugees,480,2,3,1,1,1,0,480,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.616,-1.532,-1.397,-1.336,-0.266,0.076,-2.061,-1.98,-1.16,-1.337,-1.406,-1.216,0.066,-0.036,-1.875,-1.686
first of all the thing is strictly speaking this is not influencing yeah you enact,485,2,3,1,1,1,0,485,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.61,-1.236,-1.463,-1.358,-0.149,-0.198,-2.465,-1.727,-1.482,-1.501,-1.327,-1.189,-0.366,-0.435,-1.164,-1.678
is I can so agreement between countries that it's going to be cool if you do this but then you don't really have,490,2,2,1,1,1,0,490,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.575,-1.575,-1.499,-1.378,-0.447,-0.84,-2.642,-1.825,-1.256,-1.128,-1.338,-0.974,1.018,0.639,-0.709,-1.27
to so it's an on enforcing act therefore there's no,495,2,2,1,1,1,0,495,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.373,-1.537,-1.504,-1.314,-0.31,-0.747,-2.63,-1.776,-1.27,-0.778,-1.232,-1.196,0.686,0.487,0.191,-1.185
Global there it doesn't it's not a global agreement between all these countries therefore,500,2,2,1,1,1,0,500,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.572,-1.533,-1.533,-1.374,-0.42,-0.712,-2.553,-1.843,-1.02,-0.496,-1.137,-1.079,0.916,-0.398,-0.633,-1.4
we're not going to look at that it doesn't it's not a global agreement between all these countries therefore we're not going to receive any laundry doing so good,505,3,2,1,1,1,0,505,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.558,-1.611,-1.511,-1.345,-0.36,-0.754,-2.638,-1.941,-1.269,-1.123,-1.264,-1.069,0.879,0.477,-1.558,-1.563
okay and then the other thing is Korea is,510,3,2,1,1,1,0,510,2,3,1,0,1,0,-1.289,-1.168,-1.267,-1.268,1.182,0.193,-0.24,-0.961,-1.184,-1.278,-1.194,-0.884,0.767,0.274,-2.104,-1.275
already taking in an annual number of refugees from North Korea so although,515,3,3,1,1,1,0,515,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.256,-0.933,-1.435,-1.117,-0.058,-0.082,0.526,-1.187,-1.389,-1.563,-1.445,-1.32,-0.39,-0.562,-2.968,-1.804
it's not comparable to the money Bushland but the thing is if you put on a ratio,520,2,2,1,1,0,0,520,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.384,-1.176,-1.227,-1.196,0.635,-0.282,-0.68,-1.358,-1.183,-1.023,-1.358,-1.048,0.098,0.296,-2.037,-1.121
so I'm out of breath from the article reassigned it 0.15 the,5,2,2,1,0,1,0,5,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.364,-0.882,-1.267,-1.094,1.446,0.18,0.305,-1.059,-1.505,-1.581,-1.49,-1.296,-0.531,-0.882,-2.471,-1.891
21 convention direct with Russia act which basically stated that Korea will except for Fisheries,10,2,2,1,0,1,0,10,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.329,-1.401,-1.33,-1.349,0.41,0.37,-1.618,-1.78,-1.481,-1.443,-1.504,-1.321,-0.385,-0.691,-2.357,-1.572
unlike many of the other Asian countries that did not sign it and I think it's very important,15,2,2,1,0,1,0,15,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.232,-1.18,-1.406,-1.281,1.052,-0.001,-0.87,-1.876,-1.459,-1.363,-1.514,-1.365,-0.592,-0.968,-0.748,-1.511
to create keeps up with this promise and that is becoming more,20,2,2,1,0,1,0,20,2,2,1,0,1,0,-0.844,-1.253,-1.213,-1.173,0.314,-0.229,-0.818,-1.375,-1.596,-1.559,-1.422,-1.351,-0.492,-0.927,-1.808,-1.891
and more International laws and there's a reason why I said they would exhibitions,25,2,2,1,0,1,0,25,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.478,-1.499,-1.517,-1.378,-0.636,-0.625,-1.87,-1.913,-1.607,-1.493,-1.487,-1.411,-0.58,-1.023,-2.624,-1.834
in which case I think signifies that we are ready for it first of all both financially,30,2,2,1,0,1,0,30,2,2,1,0,1,0,-0.855,-0.559,-1.033,-0.972,1.249,-0.471,-0.988,-1.351,-1.618,-1.291,-1.531,-1.366,-0.598,-0.969,-1.163,-1.664
and culturally and to suddenly turn our backs on these refugees for in Desperate,35,2,2,1,0,1,0,35,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.434,-1.304,-1.119,-1.206,0.563,0.389,-0.843,-1.612,-1.08,-0.946,-0.931,-1.117,0.957,0.101,-0.679,-1.196
situations when they're coming into our country to flee their Civil War,40,2,2,1,0,1,0,40,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.222,-1.198,-1.431,-1.298,-0.8,-0.702,-1.82,-1.79,-1.524,-1.536,-1.507,-1.342,-0.103,-0.688,-1.786,-1.594
is very hypocritical and against the words that Korea should be keeping it with International,45,2,2,1,0,1,0,45,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.621,-1.618,-1.369,-1.435,-0.895,-0.948,-2.258,-2.03,-1.552,-1.472,-1.562,-1.293,-0.546,-0.916,-1.826,-1.623
Community and I think it's very important to emphasize that the number of bring you many refugees,50,2,2,1,0,1,0,50,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.475,-1.373,-1.504,-1.374,-0.602,-0.821,-1.545,-1.899,-1.391,-1.351,-1.395,-1.237,0.569,-0.451,-1.141,-1.54
are coming in is when you about founder 15 which is very small compared to other,55,2,2,1,0,1,0,55,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.638,-1.468,-1.462,-1.382,-0.24,-0.454,-2.797,-2.009,-1.454,-1.512,-1.367,-1.225,-0.193,-0.474,-0.245,-1.287
countries which mentioned like Germany which I understand is in a different situation but even so it is still very small,60,2,2,1,0,1,0,60,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.594,-1.382,-1.409,-1.333,-0.267,-0.49,-2.416,-2.008,-1.309,-1.107,-1.403,-1.113,0.02,-0.624,-1.146,-1.55
compared to a lot of other countries for accepting many were refugees from many diverse backgrounds,65,2,2,1,0,1,0,65,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.384,-0.873,-1.45,-1.329,-0.772,-1.108,-0.443,-1.606,-1.449,-1.306,-1.395,-1.303,-0.393,-0.724,-1.327,-1.027
it looked also mention that they restricted to Jeju Island which is already,70,2,2,1,0,1,0,70,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.579,-1.416,-1.568,-1.383,-0.705,-0.974,-1.263,-1.889,-0.944,-1.303,-1.391,-1.273,0.049,-0.697,-1.212,-1.046
known for its many Chinese and other country of immigrants so it's not,75,2,2,1,0,1,0,75,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.504,-1.218,-1.279,-1.125,0.061,-0.414,-1.208,-1.662,-1.476,-1.491,-1.379,-1.31,-0.093,-0.498,-1.944,-1.707
as if there's only invading the mainland and it's very easy for us to contain them,80,2,2,1,0,1,0,80,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.422,-1.179,-1.37,-1.348,0.068,-0.711,-1.329,-1.589,-1.57,-1.541,-1.569,-1.397,-0.848,-1.17,-1.986,-1.633
and try to contain situation if people very much worried about crime or any,85,2,2,1,0,1,0,85,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.297,-1.285,-1.132,-1.26,-0.087,0.23,1.279,-1.443,-1.59,-1.518,-1.549,-1.367,-0.787,-1.119,-2.656,-1.74
other problems that arise with immigration so I think,90,2,2,1,0,1,0,90,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.562,-1.532,-1.55,-1.336,-1.058,-1.18,-1.245,-1.985,-1.388,-1.473,-1.437,-1.209,-0.479,-0.696,-1.411,-0.607
for Koreans to suddenly say all this not accepting refugees just because we are all One National,95,2,2,1,0,1,0,95,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.384,-1.501,-1.518,-1.259,-0.899,-0.946,-2.045,-1.748,-1.594,-1.491,-1.567,-1.369,-0.783,-1.151,-1.215,-1.738
what now look to the nation is very critical,100,2,2,1,0,1,0,100,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.021,-1.164,-1.386,-1.184,1.205,0.916,0.377,-1.235,-1.308,-1.023,-1.342,-1.135,-0.306,-0.658,-1.955,-1.773
and also a rash decision that shouldn't be made so quickly,105,2,2,1,0,1,0,105,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.318,-0.894,-1.335,-1.283,0.112,-0.686,-1.117,-1.237,-1.584,-1.251,-1.49,-1.354,-0.528,-0.956,-2.094,-1.771
well although I do agree that some humanitarian effort,110,2,2,1,0,1,0,110,2,2,1,0,0,0,-0.598,-0.723,-0.993,-1.023,2.858,1.016,0.046,-0.988,-1.573,-1.562,-1.574,-1.368,-0.767,-1.105,-2.585,-1.868
is needed for the Civil War I think your points exemplify exactly why Korea isn't,115,2,2,1,0,1,0,115,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.187,-0.896,-1.461,-1.151,0.58,-0.44,0.524,-1.399,-1.654,-1.46,-1.563,-1.401,-0.799,-1.12,-2.42,-1.828
actually ready for such an intake in Immigration you mentioned that he,120,3,2,1,0,1,0,120,2,2,1,0,1,0,-0.284,-0.397,-1.082,-0.834,1.055,1.089,-0.96,-1.031,-1.68,-1.563,-1.61,-1.457,-1.061,-1.255,-2.918,-1.96
only lived in a very small number of people I think it's around 500 and even with that small,125,2,2,1,0,0,0,125,2,2,1,0,1,0,0.019,-0.387,-0.997,-0.808,0.315,-0.292,-0.394,-1.092,-1.645,-1.243,-1.542,-1.314,-1.018,-1.272,-2.196,-1.714
number of refugees that we took in people have signed a petition,130,2,2,1,0,0,0,130,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.438,-1.202,-1.218,-1.184,0.119,0.345,0.776,-1.701,-1.691,-1.587,-1.605,-1.399,-1.046,-1.266,-2.836,-1.919
they've protests on the streets many people are displeased that doesn't feel like and it's neat,135,2,2,1,0,0,0,135,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.236,-1.065,-1.324,-1.209,0.092,0.586,0.068,-1.354,-1.443,-1.487,-1.499,-1.36,0.577,-0.331,-1.902,-1.708
like a small number of 500 people and also Korea is a very young nation and,140,2,2,1,0,1,0,140,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.362,-1.322,-1.273,-1.204,0.343,-0.256,0.618,-1.653,-1.354,-1.184,-1.512,-1.208,-0.31,-0.882,-0.991,-0.975
as you know that we were put into the industrial revolution,145,2,2,1,0,1,0,145,2,2,0,0,1,1,-1.052,-0.993,-0.869,-1.13,1.943,1.697,-0.292,-0.987,-1.68,-1.654,-1.613,-1.434,-1.054,-1.257,-2.804,-2.022
very quickly so I think culturally and socially we aren't actually,150,2,2,1,0,1,0,150,2,2,0,0,1,1,-1.262,-0.821,-1.096,-1.19,2.287,-0.345,-0.16,-1.176,-1.677,-1.617,-1.613,-1.42,-0.969,-1.309,-3.065,-2.088
quite ready to be such a,155,2,2,1,0,1,0,155,2,2,1,0,1,0,0.258,0.279,-0.963,-0.945,2.681,3.437,-1.003,-0.096,-1.391,-1.355,-1.509,-1.417,-0.955,-1.159,-1.728,-1.103
big police factor in the glow on the global scale for integration,160,2,2,1,0,1,0,160,2,2,1,0,1,0,-0.81,-0.845,-0.714,-0.737,2.804,4.144,0.128,-0.558,-1.443,-1.168,-1.463,-1.364,-0.896,-0.884,-2.262,-1.594
and I think the statistics show this so,165,2,2,1,0,1,0,165,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.261,-1.242,-0.904,-1.041,2.439,0.131,-0.665,-1.479,-1.507,-1.14,-1.512,-1.309,-0.974,-1.181,-1.742,-1.686
as you can actually read from the article as well most of the opposing side,170,2,2,1,0,1,0,170,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.26,-1.442,-1.275,-1.358,-0.099,-0.017,-0.414,-1.448,-1.678,-1.557,-1.608,-1.456,-1.039,-1.197,-2.665,-1.969
actually come from the younger generation of Korea even despite the more liberal,175,2,2,1,0,1,0,175,2,2,0,0,1,0,-0.275,-0.975,-0.938,-1.043,2.015,2.131,-0.223,-0.337,-1.604,-1.484,-1.573,-1.4,-1.061,-1.276,-2.93,-1.986
despite them being the more liberal portion of the population and I think that shows,180,2,2,1,0,1,0,180,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.181,-0.209,-1.216,-1.062,0.226,0.409,-0.815,-1.489,-1.646,-1.474,-1.537,-1.431,-0.874,-1.122,-2.362,-1.92
are culturally and socially Korea isn't ready for internationalism,185,2,2,1,0,1,0,185,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.066,-0.781,-0.867,-0.606,1.059,0.663,0.437,-0.779,-1.323,-1.266,-1.432,-1.346,-0.602,-0.896,-2.167,-1.153
there's also the political background of Korea and the roots of xenophobia and homogeneity in Korea where,190,2,2,1,0,1,0,190,2,2,0,0,1,0,-0.966,-0.761,-0.988,-1.12,0.962,-0.165,0.673,-0.934,-1.556,-1.516,-1.386,-1.346,-0.616,-0.837,-2.272,-1.657
we sort of stick to ourselves and we don't really care for other people they're non-korean so,195,2,2,1,0,1,0,195,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.283,-1.415,-1.123,-1.132,0.329,0.045,-2.106,-1.786,-1.476,-1.372,-1.463,-1.336,-0.123,-0.758,-2.687,-1.596
I think in that regard we're not ready in the social and cultural mask,200,2,2,1,0,1,0,200,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.106,-0.047,-1.121,-0.838,0.143,1.272,-0.929,-1.525,-1.429,-0.677,-1.349,-1.26,-0.383,-0.369,-1.572,-1.561
well you,205,2,2,1,0,1,0,205,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.458,-1.393,-1.246,-1.193,0.93,-0.071,-2.323,-1.917,-1.592,-1.34,-1.407,-1.35,-0.332,-1.017,-2.332,-1.784
said they were not really culturally socially first of all social you mentioned how,210,2,2,1,0,1,0,210,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.495,-1.502,-1.327,-1.318,0.245,-0.426,-2.712,-1.941,-1.427,-1.256,-1.403,-1.266,-0.06,-0.147,-1.485,-1.163
Korea has it's a big eyes development very quickly I would say after Korean War however if,215,2,2,1,0,1,0,215,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.26,-1.114,-0.941,-1.121,1.982,0.858,-1.485,-1.511,-1.394,-1.426,-1.436,-1.241,-0.421,-0.691,-1.568,-1.446
you look at Germany for example they also have to war to begin development really quickly it wasn't,220,2,2,1,0,1,0,220,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.537,-1.221,-1.307,-1.239,0.078,-0.314,-1.966,-1.74,-1.6,-1.558,-1.482,-1.324,-0.435,-0.758,-1.291,-1.743
until even the 80s when the Western and Eastern combined so I'm not sure if that could be technically argued,225,2,2,1,0,0,0,225,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.312,-1.477,-1.271,-1.303,0.911,0.71,-0.788,-1.408,-1.441,-1.545,-1.423,-1.277,0.241,-0.809,-1.595,-1.734
in this case it culturally yes you're right it's a lot of people not really okay,230,2,2,1,0,0,0,230,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.216,-1.556,-1.356,-1.244,-0.047,-0.531,-2.246,-1.807,-1.539,-1.512,-1.513,-1.39,-0.432,-0.536,-2.398,-1.469
with the idea of a lot of other cultures coming in especially as you've mentioned and regeneration but if there,235,2,2,1,0,0,0,235,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.382,-1.286,-1.338,-1.25,-0.013,-0.077,-2.737,-1.947,-1.071,-1.22,-1.275,-1.199,0.734,0.663,0.417,-0.985
was one article that argue that the rather than necessarily xenophobic racist,240,2,2,1,0,0,0,240,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.349,-1.155,-1.088,-1.107,1.219,0.471,-0.476,-1.457,-1.128,-0.562,-1.152,-1.186,1.281,0.329,-0.63,-0.933
just those factors it could be also due to the fact that a lot of them generation are nervous,245,2,2,1,0,0,0,245,2,2,1,0,1,0,-0.389,-0.198,-0.516,-0.539,3.346,3.154,0.393,-1.324,-1.589,-1.49,-1.329,-1.356,-0.429,-0.656,-1.733,-1.68
about the current situation you cannot be situation in Korea what they call yo U as in that,250,2,2,1,0,0,0,250,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.184,-0.045,-0.768,-1.068,2.469,1.957,-0.045,-0.803,-1.51,-1.395,-1.47,-1.344,-0.571,-0.877,-1.626,-1.741
they believe that these immigrants will be character jobs will take a lot of welfare,255,2,2,1,0,0,0,255,3,2,1,0,1,0,-1.55,-1.306,-1.17,-1.156,0.426,-0.258,-2.491,-1.573,-1.099,-1.486,-1.377,-1.177,-0.251,-0.72,-0.814,-1.092
that technically belong to the younger generation however what I like to argue is,260,2,2,1,0,0,0,260,3,2,1,0,1,0,-1.501,-1.355,-1.241,-1.306,0.787,0.045,-2.212,-1.882,-1.576,-0.696,-1.284,-1.193,0.746,-0.362,-1.916,-1.154
people are usually looking for Laura and jobs which in my opinion is actually complete opposite,265,2,2,1,0,0,0,265,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.594,-1.306,-1.29,-1.317,0.566,-0.241,-2.587,-1.972,-1.49,-1.431,-1.449,-1.324,-0.079,-0.622,-2.433,-1.876
of what the Millennials or the younger generation are looking for because someone people who graduate from college they're looking for usually,270,2,2,1,0,0,0,270,3,2,1,0,1,0,-1.022,-1.005,-1.291,-1.056,2.02,1.777,-1.315,-1.606,-1.349,-1.274,-1.432,-1.035,0.291,-0.402,-0.473,-1.679
high in jobs that pay well that will get them ready for the society for marriage for example,275,2,2,1,0,0,0,275,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.459,-0.854,-1.211,-1.29,1.512,1.851,0.235,-1.415,-1.353,-1.137,-1.426,-1.189,0.189,-0.773,-0.617,-1.681
and I feel anyone to actually filling the void in which the younger generation are very reluctant to take,280,2,2,1,0,0,0,280,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.225,-1.573,-1.01,-1.196,0.769,0.575,-0.437,-1.577,-1.321,-1.438,-1.372,-1.278,0.202,-0.09,-1.199,-1.289
so I believe that this will actually serve as a good opportunity for them and in order,285,2,2,1,0,0,0,285,2,2,1,0,1,0,-0.87,-1.436,-0.92,-0.699,1.119,0.326,0.203,-1.054,-1.45,-0.828,-1.319,-1.222,0.368,0.112,-1.528,-1.181
if we educate the people on on the effects and also the not effects,290,2,2,1,0,0,0,290,3,2,1,0,1,0,-1.438,-0.998,-1.4,-1.235,-0.096,0.082,-1.742,-1.329,-1.367,-1.345,-1.507,-1.256,-0.357,-0.479,-1.094,-0.94
that will rise for migration I think it's important to note that,295,2,2,1,0,0,0,295,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.513,-1.446,-1.477,-1.35,-0.501,-0.68,-1.034,-1.46,-1.692,-1.388,-1.52,-1.404,0.838,-0.674,-1.613,-1.829
the people will be might be more likely to support this system,300,2,2,1,0,0,0,300,2,2,1,0,1,0,-0.68,-0.513,-0.834,-0.621,1.737,1.036,0.826,-1.056,-1.565,-1.547,-1.567,-1.395,-0.699,-0.999,-2.891,-2.055
to emphasize that it's not going to create damage but impact and if it does it is possible to,305,1,2,1,0,0,0,305,2,2,1,0,1,0,-0.858,-0.337,-0.631,-1.029,2.375,0.826,1.072,-0.484,-1.387,-1.252,-1.549,-1.295,-0.221,-0.603,-0.913,-1.516
be 4 to positive then Warden - I do agree that immigrants,310,2,2,1,0,0,0,310,2,2,1,0,1,0,-0.806,-0.411,-0.889,-1.087,0.814,0.504,-0.191,-0.04,-1.699,-1.483,-1.582,-1.417,-0.902,-1.199,-2.91,-1.903
do tend to take on lower-end drops then the natives however I think that again shows,315,2,2,1,0,0,0,315,2,2,1,0,1,0,-0.378,0.339,-0.913,-0.8,1.266,1.157,-0.089,-0.843,-1.731,-1.577,-1.618,-1.446,-1.1,-1.264,-2.725,-2.021
how not ready we are as a country to let in these refugees,320,2,2,1,0,0,0,320,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.261,-0.75,-1.056,-0.966,0.989,1.401,0.648,-0.802,-1.687,-1.441,-1.612,-1.442,-0.865,-1.129,-2.709,-1.826
despite the fact despite the fact that on the global scale we already have,325,1,2,1,0,0,0,325,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.197,-1.204,-1.441,-1.182,-0.111,-0.345,0.056,-1.184,-1.697,-1.549,-1.581,-1.408,-0.932,-1.21,-2.199,-1.907
evidence of immigrants taking the raindrops just to get America Europe for this thing what is,330,2,2,1,0,0,0,330,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.354,-0.941,-1.405,-1.202,-0.447,-0.535,0.506,-1.645,-1.721,-1.464,-1.586,-1.427,-1.08,-1.343,-2.138,-1.779
it you tend to take jobs that the native Stone want and I'm pretty sure,335,2,2,1,0,0,0,335,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.031,-0.663,-0.281,-0.947,0.811,0.408,-0.609,-1.171,-1.261,-1.213,-1.54,-1.21,-0.869,-1.007,-2.246,-1.806
a lot of them generation also knows this fact and even then we're still against it,340,2,2,1,0,0,0,340,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.563,-1.45,-1.499,-1.367,-0.745,-1.042,-1.077,-1.382,-1.473,-1.247,-1.545,-1.342,-0.827,-1.158,-2.22,-1.598
and I think the fact that the younger generation is focusing on their own I guess survival,345,3,2,1,0,0,0,345,2,2,1,0,1,0,-0.542,-0.722,-1.144,-1.167,0.943,0.15,0.728,-1.004,-1.631,-1.539,-1.567,-1.383,-0.92,-1.067,-3.018,-1.985
than the lives of these people these poor people,350,2,2,1,0,1,0,350,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.287,-1.18,-1.184,-1.197,0.21,0.172,0.126,-0.408,-1.435,-1.062,-1.516,-1.299,-0.914,-1.08,-1.903,-1.671
who are escaping Civil War just goes to show that currently the imagination isn't interested in,355,2,2,1,0,1,0,355,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.387,-1.516,-1.368,-1.317,-0.159,-0.41,-1.208,-1.798,-1.535,-1.439,-1.533,-1.38,-0.966,-0.777,-2.43,-1.766
monitoring efforts and I think we should also be very careful,360,2,2,1,0,1,0,360,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.012,-1.071,-1.037,-1.106,0.161,-0.094,-1.498,-1.234,-1.697,-1.609,-1.615,-1.446,-1.054,-1.249,-2.692,-2.013
of the political we know that this issue might,365,2,2,1,0,1,0,365,2,2,1,0,1,0,-0.826,-0.32,-1.055,-1.049,3.04,0.95,-1.51,-0.915,-1.651,-1.358,-1.564,-1.399,-0.896,-1.105,-2.383,-1.92
cause as you can see in America and in Europe the political scene has become,370,3,2,1,0,1,0,370,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.668,-1.432,-1.411,-1.406,-0.565,-0.804,-1.427,-1.975,-1.339,-1.467,-1.556,-1.226,-0.432,-0.792,-2.718,-1.564
very extreme and polarized because of issues such as these and,375,2,2,1,0,1,0,375,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.136,-1.085,-1.153,-1.213,2.473,1.371,-0.116,-0.989,-1.693,-1.481,-1.512,-1.38,-0.367,-0.8,-2.751,-2.012
I can't see any way to avoid like,380,2,2,1,0,1,0,380,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.368,-1.438,-1.142,-1.252,1.02,-0.038,-1.647,-1.848,-1.444,-1.421,-1.497,-1.387,-0.533,-0.859,-2.592,-1.704
a trend towards a political extremism in terms of this issue that,385,2,2,1,0,1,0,385,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.288,-1.463,-0.759,-1.241,0.872,0.893,-1.387,-1.259,-1.532,-1.556,-1.546,-1.422,-0.755,-0.802,-2.386,-1.895

people with extremism which is a very valid argument I agree America especially has been facing this,400,3,2,1,0,1,0,400,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.376,-1.347,-1.291,-1.33,-0.354,-0.118,-1.818,-1.43,-1.505,-1.229,-1.418,-1.233,-0.042,-0.463,-0.598,-1.206
problem and Europe with the recent Syrian refugee crisis has been going through this a lot but I think,405,2,2,1,0,1,0,405,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.399,-1.006,-1.439,-1.219,-0.358,-0.595,-1.187,-1.915,-1.451,-1.372,-1.458,-1.239,-0.071,-0.49,-1.124,-1.265
it's also important to mention that I think it is also part of government,410,3,2,1,0,1,0,410,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.519,-1.318,-1.34,-1.311,-0.564,-0.882,-2.141,-1.924,-1.438,-1.259,-1.363,-1.07,-0.334,-0.101,-2.045,-1.792
kind of responsibility to keep the monastery and it's not,415,2,2,1,0,1,0,415,1,2,1,0,1,0,-0.539,-0.216,-1.281,-1.095,1.25,2.781,-0.371,-0.754,-1.286,-1.402,-1.417,-1.374,-0.058,-0.15,-1.412,-1.395

of all I think what's important is corrupting them on on wrong information factually wrong,460,2,2,1,0,0,0,460,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.357,-1.293,-1.331,-1.168,0.36,0.128,-0.015,-0.658,-1.558,-1.329,-1.492,-1.169,-0.401,-0.595,-1.608,-0.725

sure with enough intent the government would be flexible enough to allocate,255,2,2,0,0,1,0,255,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.575,-0.342,-1.041,-1.024,4.152,0.48,-1.152,-0.2,-0.933,-1.099,-1.294,-1.069,-0.003,0.36,-0.698,-0.97
enough money for both problems may be called from something that,260,2,2,0,0,1,0,260,3,2,0,0,0,0,-0.12,0.34,-0.003,-0.245,5.375,5.696,-0.612,0.538,-1.216,-1.399,-1.34,-1.005,0.116,-0.313,-0.601,-1.486
is not really,265,1,2,0,0,1,0,265,3,2,0,0,0,0,-0.163,-0.413,-0.314,-1.162,2.498,0.987,1.403,-1.21,-1.354,-1.375,-1.48,-1.278,-0.463,-0.694,-1.276,-1.703
it's not be so direct to people's lives,270,1,2,0,0,0,0,270,3,2,0,0,0,0,-0.659,-1.215,-0.376,-1.235,2.227,4.161,-0.31,0.087,-1.311,-1.029,-1.208,-1.157,0.088,-0.513,-2.237,-1.562
for example you know with any government,275,1,2,0,0,0,0,275,3,2,0,0,0,0,-0.268,-0.199,-0.604,-0.942,3.858,3.236,-0.533,-0.21,-1.636,-1.133,-1.432,-1.37,-0.357,-0.767,-1.377,-1.749
any government that's that's involved in some kind of,280,1,2,0,0,0,0,280,3,2,0,0,0,0,-0.961,-1.275,-1.214,-1.244,0.977,0.624,0.459,-1.621,-0.81,-1.265,-1.312,-1.115,0.151,-0.149,-0.86,-1.72

and the proportions are amazing how,295,1,2,0,0,0,0,295,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.503,-1.558,-1.294,-1.256,0.344,0.738,-1.386,-1.797,-0.928,-0.98,-1.287,-1.194,0.505,-0.243,0.271,-1.128
how much actually goes into the tree and how little goes into public service,300,1,2,0,0,0,0,300,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.782,-0.495,-0.529,-0.655,3.798,3.446,0.639,-0.34,-1.581,-1.241,-1.476,-1.315,-0.299,-0.046,-0.415,-1.455
and I just don't think that that's the first thing that we should focus on it's,305,1,2,0,0,0,0,305,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.336,-0.435,-0.905,-1.003,2.041,3.182,1.235,-0.938,-1.52,-1.267,-1.514,-1.328,-0.886,-1.199,-1.309,-1.528
not a weighing scale between all the cool people Korean,310,1,2,0,0,0,0,310,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.156,-1.169,-1.082,-1.055,0.802,2.724,-0.352,-1.194,-1.452,-0.901,-1.448,-1.37,-0.754,-1.104,-1.781,-1.527

you talked about the,320,1,2,0,0,0,0,320,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.365,-0.432,-0.923,-0.733,3.101,1.842,0.322,-0.63,-1.57,-1.592,-1.507,-1.445,-1.118,-1.343,-2.813,-2.039
money you talk about life we can reject the money that goes into the military and we start,325,1,2,0,0,1,0,325,2,2,0,0,0,0,1.303,1.858,0.133,-0.608,5.227,7.748,1.215,-0.167,-1.651,-1.58,-1.599,-1.418,-0.919,-1.072,-2.621,-1.998
to take care of the yemeni citizen strength but,330,1,2,0,0,1,0,330,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.929,-1.367,-0.52,-1.087,1.351,0.858,-1.315,-1.374,-1.205,-1.095,-1.382,-1.224,-0.404,-0.037,-0.121,-1.44
that's quite it's not asking for that we all,335,1,2,0,0,0,0,335,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.967,-0.896,-0.753,-0.908,2.609,1.705,1.214,-1.27,-1.567,-1.353,-1.504,-1.28,-0.298,-0.696,-2.226,-1.894
those amazing peaceful we are in a crisis of world and I was going to Korea and there,340,1,2,0,0,0,0,340,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.491,-1.364,-1.314,-1.196,0.527,-0.208,-0.926,-1.698,-1.484,-1.403,-1.291,-1.255,-0.684,-0.865,-2.002,-1.749
are political factions including the tug of Americans that encourages,345,1,2,0,0,1,0,345,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.652,1.258,0.038,-0.895,5.84,3.515,0.087,0.049,-1.466,-1.139,-1.469,-1.125,-0.666,-0.976,-0.955,-1.77
and force us to and extraneous amount of money towards the military,350,2,2,0,0,1,0,350,1,2,0,0,0,0,0.155,-0.153,-0.733,-0.841,6.098,4.309,0.217,-0.867,-1.684,-1.606,-1.601,-1.438,-1.065,-1.123,-2.534,-2.029
for their own safety and for our own safety as well so,355,2,2,0,0,0,0,355,1,2,0,0,0,0,-0.794,-0.831,-0.486,-0.826,2.279,2.232,0.693,-0.459,-1.415,-1.209,-1.511,-1.317,-0.702,-0.775,-1.069,-1.215
sure it's a good idea is if he just if,360,2,2,0,0,0,0,360,1,2,0,0,0,0,-1.519,-1.277,-1.359,-1.291,0.473,1.177,-0.719,-1.149,-1.58,-0.926,-1.429,-1.27,-0.734,-0.979,-0.088,-1.869
he stopped the war and reject money III read that money to the yemeni citizens,365,2,2,0,0,0,0,365,1,2,0,0,0,0,-0.076,-0.696,-0.364,-0.762,3.792,2.521,0.658,-1.16,-1.483,-1.03,-1.408,-0.999,0.474,0.387,-1.2,-1.458
but if that doesn't but that's not that's quite realistically,370,2,2,0,0,0,0,370,1,2,0,0,0,0,-0.213,1.521,-0.578,-0.843,2.404,1.459,-0.031,-0.309,-1.49,-0.877,-1.434,-1.297,-0.635,-0.566,-1.226,-1.191
man there are forces that we have to contend with and,375,2,2,0,0,0,0,375,1,2,0,0,0,0,-0.654,-0.446,-0.999,-1.223,1.951,0.584,-0.636,-1.104,-1.176,-1.215,-1.401,-1.189,0.084,-0.733,-0.309,-1.265
they may not allow us to make that decision so easily,380,2,2,0,0,0,0,380,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.877,-0.784,-0.595,-0.973,4.315,3.791,0.959,-1.502,-1.319,-1.037,-1.267,-1.22,-0.325,-0.462,-0.191,-1.584
so what I'm seeing is that like taking Indian citizens is great,385,2,2,0,0,0,0,385,1,2,0,0,0,0,0.14,-0.001,-0.076,-0.913,6.611,6.007,2.642,1.437,-1.378,-1.283,-1.286,-1.153,-0.232,-0.074,-1.267,-1.544
but only if the situation with situation allows self I mean I think that,390,2,2,0,0,1,0,390,1,2,0,0,0,0,-0.375,-1.016,-0.798,-1.079,1.402,1.611,0.265,-1.254,-0.92,-0.98,-1.112,-1.158,1.207,1.002,1.609,-0.752
our society can take care of that right now,395,2,2,0,0,1,0,395,1,2,0,0,0,0,-0.454,-0.796,-0.963,-1.089,2.209,4.163,-1.156,-1.168,-0.907,-1.042,-1.321,-1.103,-0.052,-0.451,0.102,-1.252

mean,405,2,2,0,0,0,0,405,1,2,0,0,0,0,-0.736,0.097,0.023,-0.823,2.552,4.087,-0.02,0.839,-1.386,-1.297,-1.45,-1.328,-0.761,-0.84,-2.046,-1.779
I guess we can go about,410,2,2,0,0,0,0,410,1,2,0,0,0,0,-1.062,-0.833,-0.774,-1.08,2,0.996,-0.193,-0.453,-1.296,-1.349,-1.447,-1.26,-0.66,-0.81,-0.767,-1.711
the whole allocation of money thinking much more detailed my,415,2,2,0,0,0,0,415,1,2,0,0,0,0,-0.762,-0.784,-1.022,-1.249,2.193,0.711,-0.023,-1.018,-1.369,-1.382,-1.292,-1.237,-0.096,-0.318,-1.135,-1.365
main point is that,420,2,2,0,0,0,0,420,1,1,0,0,0,0,-1.363,-0.72,-1.163,-1.15,0.843,0.265,0.739,-0.389,-1.393,-1.342,-1.424,-1.222,0.438,0.143,1.726,-1.131
the first thing that we think you know taken away so to speak the from,425,2,2,0,0,0,0,425,1,1,0,0,1,0,-0.856,-1.234,-1.143,-0.933,0.009,-0.039,-0.412,-0.47,-1.29,-1.376,-1.519,-1.355,-0.12,-0.758,-1.416,-1.717
the tax money shouldn't be Department of Public Service,430,1,2,0,0,0,0,430,2,1,0,0,0,0,-1.238,-1.087,-0.53,-1.126,4.463,0.755,-0.326,0.173,-1.275,-1.306,-1.194,-1.128,0.056,0.234,0.044,-1.621
it's not as if,435,1,2,0,0,0,0,435,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.336,-1.125,-1.226,-0.935,0.271,0.254,-0.459,-1.63,-1.624,-1.389,-1.465,-1.247,0.559,-0.031,-0.832,-1.511
this is a my point still stands that it's not as the money,440,1,2,0,0,1,0,440,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.234,1.078,-0.182,-0.254,4.211,5.338,-0.158,-0.287,-1.48,-1.536,-1.478,-1.329,-0.57,-0.567,-0.168,-1.689
going into the amnesty of these yemeni people is,445,1,2,0,0,1,0,445,2,2,0,0,1,0,-0.766,1.646,0.455,-0.238,5.811,5.752,1.361,-0.239,-0.358,-0.592,-1.28,-0.978,0.364,0.297,-0.873,-1.125
is directed straight from the public service cut,450,1,2,0,0,0,0,450,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.205,-0.539,-1.062,-1.122,1.507,1.625,-0.269,-0.843,-1.321,-1.32,-1.468,-1.236,0.072,-0.45,-1.524,-1.189

really do not know what the topic is,460,1,2,0,0,0,0,460,2,2,0,0,1,0,-0.958,-1.044,-0.879,-1.187,0.937,2.031,-0.395,-0.646,-1.184,-1.387,-1.302,-1.181,0.66,-0.203,0.345,-0.656
but I would still,465,1,2,0,0,0,0,465,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.015,-0.156,-0.656,-1.091,3.275,2.182,-1.032,-0.65,-1.526,-1.51,-1.436,-1.288,0.16,-0.393,-0.752,-1.627

at least at least we should really focus on,475,1,2,0,0,0,0,475,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.473,-1.285,-1.472,-1.286,-0.242,-0.285,-0.947,-1.48,-1.232,-1.369,-1.39,-1.276,0.483,-0.064,0.553,-1.341
if there are other countries that is,480,1,2,0,0,1,0,480,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.26,-1.398,-1.39,-1.298,0.624,-0.132,-0.139,-1.701,-1.36,-1.344,-1.422,-1.31,-0.563,-0.93,-2.099,-1.647
your daily people could realistically go to Ocean First consider the wires it is happening,485,1,2,0,0,0,0,485,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.387,-1.351,-1.345,-1.262,0.389,-0.397,-0.819,-1.408,-1.458,-1.572,-1.521,-1.33,-0.468,-1.062,-2.023,-1.719
already and the second point is,490,1,2,0,0,1,0,490,2,2,0,0,1,0,-0.35,-0.992,-0.789,-0.383,2.901,1.692,-0.545,0.663,-0.861,-1.107,-1.322,-1.129,-0.019,0.359,0.896,-1.788
I think people are focusing way too much on what to have these people inside,495,1,2,0,0,1,0,495,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.898,-0.863,-0.903,-1.142,1.607,0.963,0.702,-1.189,-1.278,-0.745,-1.222,-1.333,0.765,0.643,0.858,-0.611
the country or not rather than you know how to solve this crisis not know how to solve this question about what you know what we can,500,2,3,0,0,0,0,500,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.319,-1.076,-1.285,-1.279,0.038,2.342,-0.168,-1.751,-1.554,-1.463,-1.284,-1.374,-0.33,-0.52,-0.435,-1.625
do to help this crisis and we had to we should really think about what if people,505,1,2,0,0,0,0,505,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.265,-1.353,-0.997,-1.207,1.783,1.568,-0.238,-1.185,-1.565,-1.418,-1.403,-1.415,-0.65,-0.838,-1.57,-1.744
I,510,1,2,0,0,0,0,510,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.157,-0.707,-0.962,-1.247,2.235,1.509,-0.093,-0.004,-1.611,-1.217,-1.197,-1.13,1.106,-0.228,-1.128,-1.512
okay so I think one of the major cons of,5,1,2,0,0,0,0,5,1,2,0,0,0,0,-1.16,-1.251,-1.343,-1.066,-0.561,-0.005,-1.105,-0.838,-1.29,-1.046,-1.486,-1.029,0.055,-0.248,-1.275,-1.633
letting the enemies of Jesus Korea is this idea of Koreans come first so if,10,1,2,0,0,0,0,10,1,2,0,0,0,0,-1.553,-1.543,-1.552,-1.266,-0.788,-1.057,-1.762,-1.737,-0.554,-1.335,-1.206,-0.576,0.883,0.417,0.697,0.09
you look at the statistics the majority of the people who are against the Emmys,15,2,2,0,0,0,0,15,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.432,-0.646,-1.347,-1.186,0.145,-0.571,-2.403,-1.249,-1.57,-1.404,-1.461,-1.164,-0.561,-0.553,-2.028,-1.827
refugees were actually people in their twenties and thirties and middle-income individuals,20,2,2,0,0,0,0,20,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.584,-1.491,-1.487,-1.37,-0.354,-0.78,-2.544,-1.515,-1.225,-1.401,-1.48,-1.297,-0.765,-0.707,-0.731,-1.863
in the middle income class and,25,2,2,0,0,0,0,25,1,2,0,0,0,0,-1.616,-1.403,-1.594,-1.403,-1.048,-1.272,-2.379,-1.895,-1.568,-1.515,-1.481,-1.196,-0.427,-0.595,-2.421,-1.597
this is although this this is although this is a hypothesis this may stem from the fact that there's a,30,2,2,0,0,0,0,30,1,2,0,0,0,0,-1.482,-1.519,-1.549,-1.361,-0.941,-1.149,-2.325,-1.691,-1.568,-1.394,-1.452,-1.367,-0.393,-0.566,-0.446,-1.716
high levels of youth unemployment so there is this concept of this idea that,35,2,2,0,0,1,0,35,1,2,0,0,0,0,-1.668,-1.546,-1.587,-1.417,-1.085,-1.164,-2.689,-1.935,-1.365,-1.176,-1.325,-1.392,-0.367,-0.888,-1.905,-1.815
why are we letting these refugees come in and why are we spending taxpayers,40,1,2,0,0,0,0,40,1,2,0,0,0,0,-1.575,-1.169,-1.468,-1.388,-0.763,-0.647,-2.062,-1.447,-1.402,-0.937,-1.385,-1.385,1.206,-0.267,-1.575,-1.747
money on them when we should be focusing on other important issues that are more relevant to,45,2,2,0,0,0,0,45,1,2,0,0,0,0,-1.213,-1.045,-1.265,-1.26,0.116,-0.506,-0.734,-1.316,-1.309,-1.373,-1.383,-1.341,-0.408,-0.982,-2.505,-1.896
current people such as this idea of youth unemployment yeah,50,1,2,0,0,0,0,50,1,2,0,0,0,0,-1.246,-1.146,-1.429,-1.308,0.102,-0.27,-0.265,-1.242,-1.533,-1.396,-1.503,-1.257,-0.659,-0.658,-3.022,-1.967
and also the second point is that because of the mass in flux,55,2,2,0,0,0,0,55,1,2,0,0,0,0,0.566,0.507,-0.585,-0.794,4.341,3.344,2.723,-0.166,-1.327,-1.323,-1.271,-1.223,-0.458,-0.437,-1.69,-1.517
so in 2015 there said there were no in no refugees but number drastically,60,1,2,0,0,0,0,60,1,2,0,0,0,0,-1.37,-1.065,-1.21,-1.224,0.191,0,-0.63,-1.655,-1.464,-1.428,-1.536,-1.385,-0.698,-0.871,-2.683,-1.955
increased so it also seems like they could potentially be taking advantage of the system,65,1,2,0,0,0,0,65,1,2,0,0,0,0,-0.728,-0.151,-1.211,-1.209,0.854,0.036,0.107,-0.905,-1.597,-1.447,-1.425,-1.347,-0.662,-0.947,-2.82,-1.519
or Korean Korean law,70,2,2,0,0,0,0,70,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.395,-1.25,-1.375,-1.247,-0.195,-0.267,-1.575,-1.176,-1.501,-1.547,-1.48,-1.379,-0.519,-0.725,-3.005,-2.05
so yeah I heard your points,75,1,1,0,0,1,0,75,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.083,-0.389,-1.26,-0.967,1.225,0.593,-0.449,-0.538,-1.546,-1.441,-1.51,-1.346,-0.314,-0.751,-2.943,-1.968
for Mike those I'll start with my point of view first,80,2,1,0,0,1,0,80,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.565,-1.21,-1.437,-1.371,-0.532,-0.599,-1.702,-1.344,-1.543,-1.353,-1.537,-1.41,-0.765,-1.168,-1.293,-1.628
off these people giving these who came to this country came here basically,85,2,2,0,0,0,0,85,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.986,-0.668,-1.145,-0.902,1.63,-0.182,0.357,-0.777,-1.385,-1.478,-1.38,-1.293,-0.524,-0.746,-2.797,-1.777
to seek shelter from the war right the many wars I've been going on these people,90,2,2,0,0,0,0,90,3,2,0,0,0,0,-1.097,-0.932,-1.295,-1.284,-0.021,0.417,0.839,-1.476,-1.349,-1.476,-1.471,-1.386,-0.74,-0.805,-2.267,-2.014
ran away from it they don't want to participate in the war and they were basically,95,2,2,0,0,0,0,95,3,2,0,0,0,0,-1.482,-1.562,-1.544,-1.367,-0.995,-1.119,-0.829,-1.879,-1.249,-1.4,-1.423,-1.276,-0.785,-0.654,-1.978,-1.814
you know stripping from their rights to be safe and be educated,100,2,2,0,0,0,0,100,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.388,-1.125,-1.463,-1.199,-0.174,-0.195,-1.64,-1.756,-1.139,-0.979,-1.157,-1.093,-0.332,-0.4,-0.822,-1.519
and those kind of stuff and that's why they came to this country and not allowing them to,105,2,2,0,0,0,0,105,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.462,-1.297,-1.594,-1.343,-0.798,-1.092,-1.691,-1.793,-1.03,-1.242,-1.215,-1.187,0.289,0.407,-1.629,-0.86
stay in this country even though we actually made it into law that we could take them,110,2,2,0,0,0,0,110,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.281,-1.265,-1.476,-1.254,-0.793,-0.843,-2.018,-1.846,-1.312,-1.302,-1.35,-1.293,-0.337,-0.484,-1.06,-1.085
in b.o.b.,115,1,2,0,0,0,0,115,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.546,-1.412,-1.455,-1.259,-0.831,-0.796,-2.375,-1.826,-1.554,-1.426,-1.572,-1.354,-0.651,-0.871,-1.278,-1.78
it be what it called you know if he trying,120,2,2,0,0,0,0,120,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.324,-1.278,-1.459,-1.194,-0.699,-0.946,-0.914,-1.772,-1.153,-1.236,-1.07,-1.201,-0.075,0.079,-1.318,-1.548
to you know say that you're a nice person but only that be a facade right,125,2,2,0,0,0,0,125,2,1,0,0,1,0,-1.602,-1.522,-1.605,-1.409,-1.05,-1.204,-2.639,-1.993,-0.275,-0.922,-1.293,-1.142,0.594,-0.016,0.578,-0.699
you're actually a bad person but not lying not for not allowing them to be in here and,130,2,2,0,0,0,0,130,2,1,0,0,2,0,-1.562,-1.207,-1.493,-1.384,-0.858,-1.089,-2.631,-1.839,-1.208,-1.327,-1.066,-1.073,0.012,-0.077,-0.753,-1.148
that was one of the basic human rights issues and the second point would be,135,2,2,0,0,0,0,135,3,1,0,0,1,0,-1.709,-1.627,-1.624,-1.42,-1.035,-1.329,-2.845,-2.025,-1.353,-1.101,-1.416,-1.336,-0.348,-0.632,-1.356,-1.65
Koreans are not letting them because they think they are racist and rapists and,140,2,2,0,0,0,0,140,3,1,0,0,1,0,-1.244,-0.924,-1.456,-1.338,-0.881,-1.003,-0.921,-1.544,-1.59,-1.525,-1.571,-1.411,-0.722,-1.133,-1.362,-1.839
terrorists right but those things are not TRUE since,145,2,2,0,0,0,0,145,3,1,0,0,2,0,-1.694,-1.58,-1.617,-1.437,-1.15,-1.163,-2.758,-1.996,-1.405,-1.077,-1.351,-1.297,0.364,-0.286,-1.354,-1.747
they ran away from that were they are the people who don't do not like violence,150,2,2,0,0,0,0,150,3,2,0,0,0,0,-1.522,-1.295,-1.448,-1.325,-0.696,-0.988,-2.588,-1.953,-0.992,-1.165,-0.949,-1.143,-0.074,0.295,0.493,-0.128
so that's one of the main points that you could say that they don't do it like that,155,2,2,0,0,0,0,155,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.651,-1.582,-1.615,-1.43,-0.679,-0.993,-2.642,-1.898,-0.733,-0.24,-0.929,-1.098,1.969,1.998,0.333,-0.914
okay so it's our your first point was that you can you tell me your first one again,160,2,2,0,0,0,0,160,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.573,-1.398,-1.526,-1.303,-0.975,-1.124,-2.863,-1.986,-0.562,-0.632,-0.956,-1.086,1.35,1.442,-0.053,-0.908
so people get it's a basic human rights,165,2,2,0,0,0,0,165,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.531,-1.49,-1.374,-1.378,-0.663,-1.14,-1.326,-1.696,-0.96,-0.129,-0.604,-1.046,2.36,2.93,-0.648,0.074
issue Koreans made a law that would allow them to come,170,2,2,0,0,0,0,170,2,2,0,0,1,0,-0.891,-0.931,-1.304,-1.177,0.752,0.247,0.689,-0.473,-1.027,-0.764,-1.156,-1.2,0.622,2.408,-0.521,-0.736
into the country to seek shelter although since they made the,175,2,2,0,0,0,0,175,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.498,-1.527,-1.498,-1.229,-0.42,-0.408,-1.724,-1.64,-1.284,-1.154,-0.909,-1.187,1.395,1.695,-0.102,-1.167
system right it they are basically allowing it but once it happens,180,2,2,0,0,0,0,180,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.27,-1.344,-1.493,-1.327,-0.054,-0.472,0.286,-1.752,-0.953,-0.883,-0.984,-1.009,0.147,0.106,-1.997,-0.616
they're not allowing allowing it so it's basically going against what they originally,185,2,2,0,0,0,0,185,3,2,0,0,0,0,-1.15,-1.655,-1.153,-1.146,0.328,-0.214,-2.746,-1.682,-0.635,-0.002,-0.451,-0.59,0.107,0.383,1.465,-1.293
set their phones so you're saying you don't want to be like controversial,190,2,2,0,0,0,0,190,3,2,0,0,0,0,-1.563,-1.565,-1.56,-1.415,-0.76,-1.146,-1.983,-1.961,-1.04,-0.978,-0.42,-0.764,2.54,1.171,0.133,-0.427
yeah basically what you're trying to say well I think,195,2,2,0,0,0,0,195,3,2,0,0,0,0,-1.136,-1.23,-1.473,-1.247,-0.597,-1.061,-1.427,-1.653,-1.105,-0.114,-0.553,-0.96,2.06,0.785,0.647,-0.099
the ideal is good the idea of letting refugees in Turkey a country is good but,200,2,2,0,0,0,0,200,3,2,0,0,0,0,-1.684,-1.604,-1.557,-1.403,-0.984,-1.157,-2.501,-1.944,-1.702,-1.323,-1.418,-1.339,-0.66,-0.347,-1.177,-1.616
for the case of the yemenis refugees seeing this Mass influx especially,205,2,2,0,0,0,0,205,3,2,0,0,0,0,-1.458,-1.376,-1.487,-1.29,-0.571,-0.849,-0.996,-1.552,-1.532,-1.301,-1.45,-1.375,-0.76,-0.511,-1.668,-1.752
in Korea which is a much other countries with much more limited resources that countries,210,2,2,0,0,0,0,210,3,2,1,0,0,0,-1.144,-1.101,-1.132,-1.17,0.019,0.31,-0.466,-1.197,-0.982,-1.106,-0.862,-1.098,0.199,-0.042,-0.57,-1.416
in like Europe or America could possibly be seen as threatening to the community,215,2,2,0,0,0,0,215,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.278,-0.936,-1.358,-1.327,0.194,-0.558,-1.068,-1.165,-1.159,-1.23,-1.359,-1.332,-0.439,-0.893,-2.986,-1.941
people especially because it's only the island of JeJu and judge it was a very small part of Korea,220,2,2,0,0,0,0,220,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.323,-1.396,-1.328,-1.254,0.169,0.054,-1.303,-1.363,-1.369,-1.294,-1.399,-1.301,-0.89,-0.954,-1.862,-1.657
with a much more limited population so yeah,225,2,2,0,0,0,0,225,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.434,-1.23,-1.423,-1.306,-0.384,-0.304,-0.373,-1.213,-1.53,-1.479,-1.532,-1.404,-0.953,-1.156,-2.684,-1.904
yeah and I guess I guess that's kind of TRUE but you know the other point is,230,2,2,0,0,0,0,230,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.739,-0.935,-1.077,-1.068,0.654,0.957,-1.351,-0.709,-1.286,-1.543,-1.461,-1.331,-0.909,-1.133,-2.103,-1.634
that those yemenis are only 500 people right over the course of,235,2,2,0,0,0,0,235,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.862,-0.844,-1.381,-1.336,-0.226,0.399,-1.126,-0.895,-1.486,-1.523,-1.495,-1.383,-1.072,-0.984,-2.158,-1.912
these years thousand North Koreans came to this country and you know if you think about,240,2,2,0,0,0,0,240,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.486,-0.882,-0.64,-0.421,5.4,3.356,1.454,0.152,-1.24,-1.471,-1.482,-1.352,-0.626,-0.738,-1.404,-0.926
that North Koreans are currently we're at War stating their,245,2,2,0,0,0,0,245,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.528,-1.51,-1.555,-1.32,-0.941,-1.185,-2.398,-1.536,-1.195,-1.419,-1.367,-1.023,-0.595,-0.762,-1.64,-1.753
these bad people you know according to like the 50s and,250,2,2,0,0,0,0,250,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.582,-1.618,-1.598,-1.358,-1.066,-1.247,-2.842,-1.954,-1.201,-1.059,-1.2,-1.206,0.101,-0.433,-0.393,-0.542
60s people they are these bad people with the other Notions and there they could they,255,2,2,0,0,0,0,255,3,2,1,0,0,0,-1.611,-1.427,-1.555,-1.366,-1.045,-1.243,-2.071,-1.915,-1.582,-1.396,-1.481,-1.313,-0.474,-0.467,-1.729,-1.607
have the highest possibility of being spies right so in that kind of view yemenis,260,2,2,0,0,0,0,260,3,2,1,0,0,0,-1.685,-1.23,-1.517,-1.389,-0.992,-1.098,-1.738,-1.776,-1.247,-1.422,-1.158,-1.088,0.725,0.227,0.27,-0.452
they're only here to seek shelter they're not here to terrorize or anything like that it can't cats eat for see anything like that but North Koreans coming,265,2,2,0,0,0,0,265,3,2,1,0,0,0,-1.384,-1.389,-1.53,-1.32,-0.85,-1.17,-2.7,-1.587,-1.161,-1.18,-1.176,-1.228,-0.375,-0.351,-1.019,-1.384
to this country for seeking shelter could be a bigger issue than that then why are we allowing North Koreans,270,2,2,0,0,0,0,270,3,1,0,0,1,0,-1.655,-1.264,-1.584,-1.37,-1.103,-1.188,-2.818,-2.028,-1.212,-0.991,-1.061,-1.137,0.886,0.787,1.037,-0.075
to come here but not the yemenis well,275,2,2,0,0,0,0,275,3,2,0,0,1,0,-1.508,-1.444,-1.555,-1.388,-0.909,-1.146,-2.507,-1.869,-1.316,-0.134,-1.34,-1.322,0.974,0.034,-1.426,-0.381
that is a good point on a human rights level the,280,3,2,0,0,0,0,280,3,2,1,0,0,0,-1.511,-1.523,-1.54,-1.369,-1.151,-1.208,-2.711,-1.857,-0.991,-1.195,-1.146,-1.013,1.531,0.62,1.589,-1.025
I think they could be viewed in the same way but from a Korean,285,3,2,0,0,1,0,285,3,2,1,0,0,0,-1.526,-1.57,-1.58,-1.389,-0.903,-1.174,-2.793,-1.94,-1.131,-1.363,-1.33,-1.279,0.02,-0.585,-2.421,-1.95
citizens perspective North Korea is still,290,2,2,0,0,1,0,290,3,2,1,0,0,0,-1.577,-1.519,-1.535,-1.36,-0.581,-0.758,-1.954,-1.872,-1.052,-1.399,-1.181,-1.145,0.63,-0.101,-1.261,-1.193
part of current it can still be viewed as an extension of Korea that was just simply divided because the war,295,2,2,0,0,1,0,295,3,2,1,0,0,0,-1.45,-1.18,-1.491,-1.334,-0.56,-0.813,-1.953,-1.501,-1.337,-1.486,-1.489,-1.4,-0.746,-0.624,-2.952,-2.003
and especially because it was only a career isn't was only divided like 50 or 60,300,2,2,0,0,1,0,300,3,2,1,1,0,0,-0.894,-0.7,-1.059,-0.939,3.208,1.347,0.468,-0.069,-1.335,-1.367,-1.312,-1.282,-0.444,-0.847,-2.902,-1.865

but for the yemenis I think it's possible that Korean citizens can view them as Outsiders,310,2,2,0,0,1,0,310,3,3,1,0,0,0,-1.271,-1.065,-1.063,-1.23,0.542,0.736,-0.274,-1.636,-1.421,-1.424,-1.374,-1.369,-0.656,-0.804,-1.921,-1.981

on their own intent on internal struggle even though their heart South Korea is a nation,495,2,2,0,0,1,0,495,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.026,-0.966,-1.329,-1.091,0.726,0.42,0.222,-1.481,-0.918,-1.107,-0.783,-1.253,0.757,0.904,-0.632,-1.659

export and an agent that should be able to and and personally I think that,505,2,2,0,0,1,0,505,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.555,-1.323,-1.474,-1.349,-0.859,-0.668,-1.344,-1.57,-1.38,-1.365,-1.323,-1.378,-0.362,-0.122,-1.625,-1.78
the time I'll start okay so I'm against,5,2,2,1,0,1,0,5,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.474,-1.309,-1.47,-1.267,0.943,-0.375,-1.931,-1.539,-1.597,-1.546,-1.425,-1.359,-0.633,-0.289,-2.704,-1.974
the integration of refugees to Korea so,10,2,3,1,0,1,0,10,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.255,-1.092,-1.111,-1.154,1.68,0.775,-0.719,-1.456,-1.038,-0.431,-0.657,-1.164,1.644,1.79,1.062,-0.557
my main point is I 3 main points firstly,15,2,3,1,0,1,0,15,2,2,1,0,1,0,-0.654,-0.314,-0.971,-1.041,1.303,2.335,-0.339,-0.692,-0.193,-0.938,-0.842,-1.134,2.044,0.364,1.278,-0.921
I think it's important to take care of the Korean Nationals first and,20,2,2,1,0,1,0,20,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.212,-0.686,-1.034,-1.233,0.827,-0.257,-0.346,-0.874,-0.768,-1.388,-0.962,-1.067,2.242,2.604,-0.459,0.294
then look after the refugee refugees I know it's a great thing to help other people,25,1,2,1,0,1,0,25,2,2,1,0,1,0,-0.878,-0.642,-1.2,-1.135,1.209,0.032,0.374,-1.419,-1.516,-1.344,-1.138,-1.293,0.527,0.001,-1.809,-1.504
and the gospel others but I think it's more important to look after our,30,1,2,1,0,1,0,30,2,2,1,0,1,0,0.662,1.079,-0.573,-0.936,1.763,-0.045,-0.229,-0.892,-1.542,-1.413,-0.88,-1.205,0.03,-0.046,-2.753,-1.88
people first so if we look at an example of since breathtaking refugees is kind of a big,35,1,2,1,0,1,0,35,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.284,-0.706,-1.398,-0.949,1.249,-0.297,-0.375,-1.096,-1.636,-1.525,-1.484,-1.306,-0.517,-0.202,-1.455,-1.683
boundary if we look this into small boundary I think we can compare it with,40,1,2,1,0,1,0,40,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.129,-1.463,-1.278,-1.168,0.252,-0.46,-0.403,-1.836,-1.097,-1.306,-1.178,-0.976,0.673,2.217,0.995,-1.148
a family so let's say the young family was ten,45,1,2,1,0,1,0,45,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.507,-1.257,-1.441,-1.253,-0.615,-0.691,-0.457,-1.507,-1.089,-0.958,-0.854,-1.207,1.843,1.997,1.105,-0.911
children and I'm not that wealthy and some of the children are getting enough food and,50,1,2,1,0,1,0,50,2,2,1,0,1,0,-0.518,-0.736,-0.223,-1.027,1.146,0.818,0.326,-1.23,-0.637,-0.677,-0.41,-1.013,4.459,4.137,0,-1.408
some aren't some are getting a good education but some are we the education at have,55,1,2,1,0,1,0,55,2,2,1,0,1,0,0.439,1.938,-0.187,-0.677,8.559,6.232,1.137,0.366,-1.242,-1.376,-1.087,-1.159,-0.148,0.368,-1.841,-1.418
a bad environment for upbringing but just because,60,1,2,1,0,1,0,60,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.015,-0.84,-1.186,-1.038,1.529,-0.099,-0.931,-1.194,-1.422,-1.047,-1.242,-1.253,0.78,0.439,-1.248,-1.61
other wealthy families are taking adopting children,65,1,2,1,0,1,0,65,1,2,1,0,1,0,0.061,-0.274,-1.312,-0.77,0.932,0.013,1.811,-1.278,-1.41,-1.449,-0.978,-1.2,0.268,0.294,-2.374,-1.484
adopting is a great thing to do on these things have children and it's great,70,1,2,1,0,0,0,70,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.313,-1.399,-0.958,-0.696,2.397,1.894,-2.028,-0.722,-1.544,-1.278,-1.371,-1.364,-0.216,-0.225,-0.465,-1.824
but would it be good to take in children,75,1,2,1,0,0,0,75,1,2,1,0,1,0,-0.231,-0.618,-0.872,-0.776,4.558,1.637,0.477,0.037,-1.509,-1.396,-1.444,-1.319,-0.504,-0.523,-2.804,-1.621
adopt children when you can't even take care of your own children properly,80,1,2,1,0,1,0,80,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.043,-0.853,-1.05,-0.629,0.299,-0.093,0.011,-1.418,-1.689,-1.504,-1.412,-1.38,-0.928,-0.705,-2.705,-2.007
so I think it's best thing is to take care of our children,85,1,2,1,0,1,0,85,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.428,-1.237,-1.305,-1.33,-0.211,-0.248,-0.916,-1.652,-1.378,-1.266,-1.395,-1.384,-0.432,-0.773,-1.477,-1.817
Fist and then look off balance so that's my first point and,90,1,2,1,0,1,0,90,1,2,1,0,1,0,-0.961,-1.198,-1.134,-1.142,0.395,-0.136,-0.265,-0.629,-1.457,-1.289,-1.424,-1.294,0.049,-0.254,-2.025,-1.707
my second point is that the people are mainly,95,1,2,1,0,1,0,95,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.01,-0.551,-1.284,-1.134,1.255,-0.017,0.772,-1.531,-1.347,-0.594,-1.247,-1.286,1.748,0.467,-1.453,-1.71
Muslim and it's not to do with race I'm not being,100,1,2,1,0,1,0,100,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.434,-1.544,-1.51,-1.298,-0.846,-0.651,-1.602,-1.698,-1.595,-1.567,-1.517,-1.426,-0.511,-0.42,-2.701,-1.982
I'm not being racist in the fact that,105,1,2,1,0,1,0,105,1,2,1,0,1,0,0.255,0.072,-0.781,-0.798,2.631,1.265,-0.162,-1.057,-1.582,-1.447,-1.277,-1.305,0.375,0.203,-2.629,-1.823
I think it's to do with the cultural thing,110,1,2,1,0,1,0,110,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.511,-1.251,-1.294,-1.326,1.807,0.115,-1.077,-1.674,-1.417,-1.418,-1.309,-1.402,-0.088,-0.172,-1.77,-1.888
and,115,1,2,1,0,1,0,115,1,2,1,0,1,0,-0.579,1.437,0.507,1.154,12.748,15.116,-0.885,1.057,-1.161,-0.663,-0.954,-1.244,1.091,1.388,-1.625,-0.875
okay so if I'm I'm for immigration I guess so,120,2,2,1,0,1,0,120,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.536,-1.035,-1.458,-1.302,-0.39,-0.932,-1.65,-1.618,-1.048,-0.936,-1.032,-1.121,0.967,0.82,-0.592,-1.011
let me just address your first point about taking care of Korean Nationals first,125,2,2,1,0,1,0,125,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.473,-1.175,-1.397,-1.296,-0.103,-0.288,-1.575,-1.745,-1.297,-1.308,-1.117,-1.258,1.505,1.015,-0.05,-1.216
so yeah Korea should take care of their Nationals as well,130,2,2,1,0,1,0,130,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.575,-1.344,-1.446,-1.316,-0.254,-0.64,-1.51,-1.833,-1.293,-0.84,-1.047,-1.17,1.445,0.742,-0.27,-0.794
but just because you know having refugees,135,2,2,1,0,1,0,135,3,2,1,0,1,0,-1.622,-1.428,-1.381,-1.443,-0.256,-0.959,-2.352,-1.945,-1.399,-1.07,-1.157,-1.173,1.33,-0.012,-0.264,-1.484
who are applying for jobs that it could go to Koreans doesn't necessarily mean that they're not taking,140,2,2,1,0,1,0,140,3,3,1,0,1,0,-1,-1.393,-1.458,-1.302,-0.216,-0.778,-0.806,-1.388,-1.329,-1.09,-1.143,-1.057,1.233,1.705,-0.95,-1.019
care of Koreans in a way because what if those what if Koreans don't want those jobs,145,1,2,1,0,0,0,145,3,3,2,0,1,0,-1.542,-1.363,-1.489,-1.349,-0.635,-0.46,-1.464,-1.735,-0.701,-0.841,-0.491,-1.034,1.716,2.244,0.37,-0.373
than all those small menial jobs would just then go to refugees and in a way it would help Korean,150,1,2,1,0,0,0,150,3,3,2,0,1,0,-1.684,-1.539,-1.604,-1.434,-1.056,-1.204,-2.681,-1.956,-1.425,-0.864,-1.094,-1.223,0.749,1.525,-0.546,-1.322
society and just because creating some creating Nationals are poor that's not the fault,155,2,2,1,0,0,0,155,3,3,1,0,1,0,-1.608,-1.523,-1.494,-1.361,-0.664,-1.049,-2.822,-1.978,-0.794,-0.243,-1.095,-0.857,1.277,1.506,0.106,-1.134
of the government maybe it's the fault of the of the person of,160,1,2,1,0,1,0,160,3,2,1,0,1,0,-1.643,-1.369,-1.596,-1.365,-0.95,-1.167,-2.804,-1.711,-0.885,-0.614,-0.511,-0.676,1.996,2.987,0.033,-0.186
the LOL it's maybe their own motivation that they lost so that they can't find a job they can't take,165,2,2,1,0,1,0,165,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.578,-1.43,-1.552,-1.331,-0.811,-1.034,-0.926,-1.634,-1.315,-1.159,-1.384,-1.244,-0.045,0.162,-0.752,-1.494
care of themselves and also for a second point,170,2,2,1,0,1,0,170,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.322,-1.037,-1.435,-1.214,-0.5,-0.604,-0.558,-1.482,-1.052,-0.716,-1.123,-1.137,0.898,0.74,0.748,-0.933
I think I have an idea of where you were going and to be honest Muslims,175,2,2,1,0,1,0,175,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.672,-1.565,-1.501,-1.333,-0.651,-0.878,-2.596,-1.947,-1.146,-0.503,-1.184,-1.034,0.796,0.924,0.209,-0.546
are actually considered one of the religions that is very well respected and,180,2,3,1,1,1,0,180,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.398,-1.071,-1.293,-1.107,-0.528,-0.827,-2.334,-1.451,-0.864,-0.332,-1.004,-0.412,4.555,3.67,0.122,-0.958
culturally they keep a lot of ground rules but those people extremists,185,1,3,1,1,1,0,185,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.549,-1.396,-1.556,-1.348,-0.755,-1.005,-2.793,-1.609,-1.115,-1.17,-1.164,-1.151,1.863,1.191,-0.639,-1.285
are the ones who don't stick to those rules and want to add more rules of their own,190,2,3,1,1,1,0,190,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.602,-1.329,-1.552,-1.413,-0.837,-1.162,-2.325,-1.868,-1.289,-1.203,-1.232,-1.045,0.987,0.52,1.242,-0.835
to that religion so it's not necessarily religious wise,195,2,3,1,1,1,0,195,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.686,-1.55,-1.564,-1.409,-0.982,-1.237,-2.994,-2.074,-0.882,-0.806,-1.125,-1.198,1.93,0.876,-0.857,-1.396
and I think that,200,2,3,1,1,1,0,200,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.45,-1.308,-1.57,-1.337,-0.947,-0.987,-2.718,-1.932,-1.523,-1.025,-1.421,-1.281,-0.043,0.115,-1.285,-1.676
Korea as a homogeneous society should actually become a little bit more heterogeneous and more,205,1,2,1,1,0,0,205,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.494,-1.514,-1.593,-1.423,-1.02,-1.16,-2.798,-2.005,-1.435,-1.092,-1.392,-1.218,0.375,0.703,0.259,-1.392
of a cultural Melting Pot like other First World countries yeah I think that's,210,2,2,1,1,0,0,210,2,2,1,0,0,0,2.532,2.344,2.069,0.637,13.928,9.961,0.162,-0.779,-1.375,-1.521,-1.409,-1.337,0.243,-0.095,-0.989,-1.515
it so yours you said that the poor people in Korea,215,2,2,1,1,0,0,215,2,2,1,0,0,0,-0.269,0.044,-0.653,-0.099,3.867,2.497,1.076,0.452,0.512,-0.721,-0.691,-1.227,2.785,1.712,1.171,-0.874
are the fault of their own and it's not the government that's what you said and I agree that some,220,2,2,1,0,0,0,220,2,2,1,0,0,0,-0.127,-0.297,-0.269,-0.937,4.91,4.971,0.335,1.239,-1.427,-1.445,-1.369,-1.376,1.046,0.115,-1.634,-1.7
people in might be the case for some people that,225,2,2,1,0,0,0,225,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.261,-0.907,-1.178,-1.033,0.892,0.615,0.455,0.119,-1.302,-1.204,-1.326,-1.187,-0.002,-0.746,-1.395,-1.526
I was brought up in the UK and the situation will be different there,230,2,2,1,0,0,0,230,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.045,-0.96,-1.249,-1.301,1.324,2.372,-0.7,-0.775,-1.39,-1.024,-1.175,-1.099,0.927,1.554,-1.291,-1.628
is still poor people in Britain but the government,235,1,2,1,0,0,0,235,2,2,1,0,0,0,-0.707,0.025,-0.524,-0.777,1.557,1.789,0.132,-0.307,-1.135,-1.024,-1.097,-1.215,0.517,0.636,-1.962,-0.956
helping the poor people is extremely different from Korea and victim,240,2,2,1,0,0,0,240,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.15,0.428,-0.968,-1.06,3.209,2.838,0.144,1.2,-1.668,-1.615,-1.4,-1.374,-0.339,-0.523,-2.719,-1.83
I think the government isn't doing enough to help the disabled,245,2,2,1,0,0,0,245,2,3,1,0,0,0,-0.991,-0.893,-1.283,-1.204,1.571,0.083,0.193,-1.24,-1.294,-0.314,-1.215,-1.065,2.276,0.846,-1.345,-0.742

okay Point she said that they are abusing the law but the question of the debate is whether Korea should,100,2,2,0,0,0,0,100,1,2,0,0,0,0,-1.078,-0.97,-1.382,-1.237,0.403,0.1,-0.143,-1.233,-1.398,-1.472,-1.383,-1.279,-0.534,-0.902,-0.913,-1.404
accept the refugees and therefore the law is not the issue if they're abusing the law we can change the law,105,2,2,0,0,0,0,105,1,2,0,0,0,0,-1.437,-0.803,-1.373,-1.275,0.731,-0.417,-0.254,-1.32,-1.524,-1.154,-1.428,-1.334,-0.545,-1.104,-1.387,-1.761
so that they can stay in more legally without using the sides,110,2,2,0,0,0,0,110,1,2,0,0,1,0,-1.324,-0.997,-1.479,-1.232,-0.201,-0.541,-1.411,-1.408,-0.988,-1.289,-1.289,-1.077,-0.29,-0.26,-0.257,-0.872
gates in the law and the second you said that Koreans and Muslims are so different that it's it's not realistic that they live together,115,2,2,0,0,0,0,115,1,2,0,0,1,0,-1.086,-1.103,-1.501,-1.397,-0.018,-0.323,-0.459,-1.734,-1.212,-0.638,-0.99,-1.125,-0.406,-0.572,-0.262,-1.287

thousands of refugees and they have done,125,2,3,0,0,0,0,125,1,2,0,0,1,0,-1.624,-1.571,-1.534,-1.38,-0.289,-0.829,-1.668,-1.647,-1.327,-1.252,-1.464,-1.289,-0.535,-0.705,-0.383,-1.667
well and in contrast Korea is only old as Korea,130,2,3,0,0,0,0,130,1,2,0,0,1,0,-1.641,-1.545,-1.414,-1.393,-0.234,-0.885,-2.55,-1.75,-0.985,-0.338,-1.112,-0.765,0.557,1.122,-0.117,-0.392
only has to accept like 550 refugees which is a very small portion compared to what,135,2,3,0,0,0,0,135,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.292,-1.211,-1.316,-1.266,0.551,-0.332,-0.192,-1.569,-0.903,-0.861,-1.25,-1.189,-0.245,-0.401,0.146,-1.866
countries like Germany and France are doing and he said that Muslims,140,2,3,0,0,0,0,140,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.259,-0.713,-1.419,-1.331,0.122,-0.758,-0.8,-1.464,-0.941,-0.826,-0.983,-1.137,0.868,0.127,0.163,-0.006
will have difficulties settling in Korea but they don't have any choices they chose Korea,145,2,3,0,0,0,0,145,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.493,-1.403,-1.565,-1.405,-0.181,-0.832,-2.472,-1.831,-0.911,0.886,-1.083,-1.041,0.982,1.004,1.024,-0.633
because at least it's better than staying in their home country,150,2,3,0,0,0,0,150,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.582,-1.468,-1.493,-1.339,-0.365,-0.872,-1.203,-1.776,-1.073,-1.172,-1.263,-1.146,0.292,0.146,0.737,-1.109
so I think the refugees don't have a choice,155,2,3,0,0,0,0,155,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.601,-1.377,-1.34,-1.398,0.053,-0.367,-1.166,-1.284,-1.046,-1.128,-0.636,-0.986,0.113,-0.114,-0.754,-1.212
and it's it's rather an obligation that they stayed here,160,2,3,0,0,0,0,160,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.372,-1.144,-1.436,-1.369,-0.252,-0.181,-0.301,-1.117,-1.491,-1.215,-1.329,-1.29,-0.478,-0.659,-0.617,-1.405
so for the first point of argument is that,165,2,3,0,0,0,0,165,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.289,-1.381,-1.435,-1.316,-0.006,-0.515,0.248,-1.583,-1.454,-1.526,-1.498,-1.344,-0.839,-0.999,-1.171,-1.855
they are abusing the law and so there was a petition to the blue house,170,2,3,0,0,0,0,170,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.395,-1.144,-1.297,-1.243,0.564,-0.402,-1.807,-1.317,-1.325,-1.032,-1.383,-1.272,-0.374,-0.831,-0.15,-1.449
where the people were like change the law to not,175,2,3,0,0,0,0,175,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.349,-1.038,-1.388,-1.35,0.035,-0.68,-0.999,-1.337,-0.91,-1.31,-0.9,-1.175,0.834,0.085,-0.372,-1.133
not let the Immigrant in and so what the government did was to change the law and excluded,180,1,2,0,0,1,0,180,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.107,-1.164,-1.158,-1.242,1.071,0.339,0.428,-1.26,-0.695,-1.041,-0.937,-1.078,0.196,0.04,-0.74,-0.244
your man from Visa free program so from now on except for the 550,185,2,2,0,0,1,0,185,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.997,-0.82,-1.035,-0.613,2.164,0.762,0.873,-0.114,-1.409,-1.418,-1.371,-1.264,-0.396,-0.508,-2.021,-1.9
people who are all already inside the Jeju Island o Maryam and people,190,1,2,0,0,1,0,190,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.639,-0.831,-1.101,-1,1.549,1.367,0.12,0.272,-1.32,-1.491,-1.414,-1.279,-0.7,-0.845,-2.743,-1.901
can come in so from now on it illegal and second,195,1,2,0,0,1,0,195,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.451,0.283,-0.963,-0.845,4.14,2.005,0.595,-0.397,-1.542,-1.572,-1.4,-1.36,-0.781,-0.937,-2.796,-1.994
difference Germany and yeah I think they should let the immigrants in,200,1,2,0,0,1,0,200,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.192,-0.645,-1.027,-0.813,2.619,0.75,1.455,-0.229,-1.319,-1.249,-1.262,-1.172,-0.597,-0.671,-1.583,-1.576
because let me think about all those crises originated from is from,205,2,2,0,0,1,0,205,1,2,0,0,0,0,-1.644,-1.338,-1.527,-1.301,0.071,-0.534,-1.214,-1.758,-1.247,-1.296,-1.31,-0.919,-0.119,-0.191,-1.21,-1.681
the colonial period when the European countries invaded Africa and,210,2,2,0,0,1,0,210,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.138,-0.964,-1.438,-1.078,0.282,0.381,-0.563,-0.966,-1.588,-1.527,-1.462,-1.374,-1.005,-0.903,-2.786,-2.023
set the ruler rulers in their own taste so they have like historical responsibilities,215,1,2,0,0,1,0,215,2,2,0,0,0,0,0.107,0.923,-1.3,-1.117,3.254,1.779,1.621,1.445,-1.613,-1.556,-1.37,-1.379,-0.177,-0.865,-2.479,-1.975
to let immigrants in but for example Korea don't have any kind of those connections,220,2,2,0,0,1,0,220,2,3,0,0,0,0,-1.484,-1.206,-1.503,-1.193,0.399,-0.097,-0.919,-1.686,-1.481,-1.356,-1.455,-1.379,-0.517,-1.012,-2.778,-1.802
to military Middle East Country so yeah I don't think there is,225,2,2,0,0,0,0,225,2,3,0,0,0,0,-1.08,-0.497,-1.118,-1.124,0.916,0.204,0.701,-0.433,-1.194,-1.141,-1.304,-1.285,-0.547,-0.599,-2.369,-1.738
I think rather than Korea maybe European countries who,230,1,2,0,0,0,0,230,2,3,0,0,0,0,-1.171,-0.289,-1.236,-1.236,2.117,0.258,-1.632,-1.393,-1.079,-1.273,-1.278,-1.249,0.083,-0.393,-1.979,-1.567
created all those meth should let those immigrants thing right,235,1,2,0,0,0,0,235,2,3,0,0,0,0,-1.472,-1.221,-1.445,-1.341,-0.07,-0.616,-1.847,-1.763,-1.389,-1.305,-1.515,-1.334,-0.773,-0.677,0.596,-1.69
you said that the law makes the refugees movements illegal but,240,1,2,0,0,0,0,240,2,3,0,0,0,0,-1.434,-1.421,-1.544,-1.42,-0.618,-1.073,-2.593,-1.549,-1.375,-1.501,-1.441,-1.297,-0.544,-0.897,-1.461,-1.326
the question of the debate is whether that should be legal or illegal so whether the laws are illegal,245,2,2,0,0,0,0,245,2,3,0,0,0,0,-1.669,-1.487,-1.59,-1.366,-0.761,-1.167,-2.384,-1.947,-1.393,-0.756,-1.323,-1.265,-0.174,-0.625,-1.609,-1.058
right now is irrelevant from this debate because that's what we are deciding right now whether we should change the laws so that,250,1,2,0,0,0,0,250,2,3,0,0,0,0,-1.634,-1.5,-1.54,-1.43,-0.811,-0.91,-2.559,-1.904,-1.341,-1.131,-1.406,-1.133,-0.318,-0.432,-0.291,-1.413
refugees should be accepted into Korea and the second you said that,255,2,2,0,0,0,0,255,2,3,0,0,0,0,-1.646,-1.548,-1.56,-1.439,-0.636,-1.067,-2.624,-1.938,-1.102,-0.83,-1.06,-1.035,-0.439,-0.188,0.11,-1.562
France and Germany are different because they have historic ties to the Muslim countries,260,2,2,0,0,1,0,260,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.688,-1.516,-1.585,-1.423,-0.901,-1.268,-2.727,-1.815,-1.274,-1.015,-1.375,-1.076,-0.154,-0.746,-0.172,-1.214
but but Korea also part,265,2,2,0,0,1,0,265,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.695,-1.474,-1.566,-1.34,-0.907,-1.078,-2.517,-1.828,-1.359,-1.121,-1.369,-1.267,-0.413,-0.781,-0.521,-1.405
of the United Nations has signed at the convention so they also have the international obligation,270,2,2,0,0,1,0,270,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.645,-1.587,-1.612,-1.452,-1.078,-1.293,-2.849,-2.043,-1.265,-0.996,-1.329,-1.231,-0.512,-0.035,-0.13,-1.344
to accept refugees when there is a crisis and also,275,2,2,0,0,1,0,275,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.562,-1.389,-1.544,-1.434,-1.072,-1.133,-1.57,-1.944,-0.373,-0.785,-1.112,-1.161,0.576,-0.156,-0.687,-1.246
German is certainly not accepting the refugees because they have historical responsibilities,280,2,2,0,0,1,0,280,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.626,-1.572,-1.575,-1.376,-0.303,-1.114,-2.301,-1.908,-1.432,-1.161,-1.041,-1.206,0.755,0.27,0.554,-0.796
to Syrian refugees sexually though relationship is very weak between Syria and,285,2,2,0,0,1,0,285,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.528,-1.217,-1.52,-1.398,-0.727,-0.938,-1.571,-1.772,-1.205,-1.022,-1.19,-1.165,0.364,-0.411,-0.542,-1.009
Germany it's not like Germany and Israel and so but they are accepting the refugees,290,2,2,0,0,1,0,290,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.721,-1.558,-1.645,-1.453,-1.189,-1.323,-2.636,-1.993,-0.69,0.123,-0.752,-0.118,1.871,1.431,-1.013,-0.204
because that's the that's the so it's that's the sort of behavior,295,2,2,0,0,1,0,295,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.504,-0.419,-1.289,-1.17,-0.261,-0.766,-0.655,-0.598,-1.034,-1.24,-1.381,-1.265,-0.51,-0.463,0.794,-1.509
they must show as a developed country and Korea to is a developed country and it,300,2,2,0,0,1,0,300,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.427,-1.409,-1.386,-1.298,0.612,-0.613,-1.14,-1.706,-0.013,-0.91,-0.96,-0.711,0.255,0.421,0.697,-0.232
is very capable of accepting 550 refugees when countries like France and Germany are accepting,305,2,2,0,0,1,0,305,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.602,-1.332,-1.433,-1.321,-0.203,-0.381,0.489,-1.573,-0.664,-1.33,-0.843,-1.055,-0.315,0.455,-1.332,-1.744
"100,000 refugees every year so I think refugees",310,2,2,0,0,1,0,310,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.945,-1.015,-1.372,-1.159,1.805,0.197,1.089,-0.99,-0.927,-0.915,-1.194,-1.043,0.664,0.102,0.575,-0.578
should be learning so although they're like 550 people if you,315,2,2,0,0,0,0,315,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.552,-1.46,-1.488,-1.322,-0.544,-0.583,-1.084,-1.746,-0.76,-1.147,-1.136,-1.114,-0.257,-0.402,-1.857,-1.59
make exceptions for those if Yemen crisis,320,2,2,0,0,0,0,320,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.028,-1.048,-1.327,-1.139,1.434,-0.4,0.267,-0.818,-1.242,-1.308,-1.219,-1.332,0.022,-0.356,-1.905,-1.687
that will fertile lead into other immigrants in the future which might probably more,325,2,2,0,0,0,0,325,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.102,-1.283,-1.299,-1.329,0.11,-0.8,0.088,-1.61,-1.222,-1.351,-1.429,-1.338,-0.719,-0.675,-2.907,-1.927
and more that's what that's how the European immigrant crisis started and,330,2,2,0,0,0,0,330,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.807,-1.253,-1.477,-1.355,0.42,0.134,-0.819,-1.633,-1.438,-1.499,-1.158,-1.301,-0.272,0.225,-2.369,-1.812
also lots of European countries and lots of European countries most of,335,3,2,0,0,1,0,335,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.386,-0.958,-1.391,-1.282,1.723,-0.432,0.139,-0.323,-1.097,-1.322,-1.345,-1.283,-0.276,-0.045,-1.981,-1.665
most of the students are against the refugee because cauldrons bit different and they cause like,340,3,2,0,0,1,0,340,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.562,-0.959,-1.538,-1.311,-0.123,-0.332,-0.309,-1.56,-1.128,-1.077,-1.054,-1.255,0.566,0.133,-0.462,-1.279
social confusion so I think those kind of confusion will be even much,345,3,2,0,0,1,0,345,3,2,0,0,1,0,0.084,2.139,-1.017,-0.527,3.367,2.596,-0.159,0.735,-1.35,-1.342,-1.281,-1.274,-0.487,-0.317,-2.345,-1.916
larger in Korea because the culture itself is,350,2,2,0,0,1,0,350,3,2,0,0,1,0,-1.503,-1.058,-0.938,-0.918,0.869,1.767,-0.459,-0.984,-1.186,-1.125,-1.353,-1.279,0.161,0.566,-0.041,-1.432
two different and also although there is no like confirmation,355,2,2,0,0,1,0,355,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.16,-1.232,-1.4,-1.195,0.745,0.66,0.533,-1.265,-1.023,-1.026,-1.155,-1.059,-0.115,-0.369,-0.887,-1.329
that they actually create like a crime the people in Jeju,360,2,2,0,0,0,0,360,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.792,-0.02,-1.258,-1.18,1.243,0.628,-0.629,-0.765,-1.423,-1.312,-1.423,-1.362,-0.736,-0.299,-2.369,-1.934

talks about about that thing and she sometimes though them and she doesn't want to see,370,2,2,0,0,0,0,370,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.289,-0.929,-1.528,-1.331,-0.363,-0.167,-0.696,-1.654,-1.469,-1.402,-1.485,-1.389,-0.244,-0.913,-2.474,-1.767
those people there so yeah I think it's for,375,2,2,0,0,0,0,375,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.439,-1.393,-1.415,-1.358,-0.321,-0.679,-1.307,-1.745,-1.559,-1.495,-1.467,-1.351,-0.861,-1.071,-2.449,-1.815
the for the Yemen people yeah it is TRUE that,380,3,2,0,0,0,0,380,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.608,-1.21,-1.256,-1.322,1.264,0.102,-1.125,-1.454,-1.609,-1.578,-1.487,-1.409,-0.89,-0.997,-2.178,-1.966
we should take care of them for a while but after the crisis settle down they,385,2,3,0,0,0,0,385,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.557,-1.442,-1.478,-1.305,-0.677,-0.86,-2.363,-1.667,-1.385,-1.186,-1.355,-0.98,-0.237,-0.459,-1.194,-1.483
should go back but I'm not sure whether they will try to stake in Korea even further because,390,2,3,0,0,0,0,390,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.616,-1.579,-1.418,-1.251,-0.457,-0.762,-1.766,-1.887,-1.247,-1.324,-1.282,-1.117,0.395,-0.57,-1.14,-1.074
it is developed country yes I'm bit confused about that,395,1,3,0,0,0,0,395,2,3,0,0,0,0,-1.499,-1.44,-1.475,-1.319,-0.528,-0.897,-1.958,-1.843,-1.464,-1.519,-1.417,-1.266,-0.55,-0.723,-1.687,-1.674

I understand your idea but I think the case of USA,100,2,2,0,0,2,0,100,1,2,0,0,1,0,-0.106,-0.52,-0.926,0.016,2.788,1.515,1.314,-0.568,1.319,0.396,-0.879,-0.358,1.503,0.437,0.313,1.512
is a case of 30 of like almost a century ago,105,2,2,0,0,2,0,105,1,2,0,0,1,0,-1.056,-0.804,-1.034,-1.062,2.044,1.482,1.306,-0.354,0.082,-0.285,-0.272,-0.484,4.136,4.061,-0.038,0.052
and it should be up to occur it shouldn't be applicable to now because as you can see,110,3,2,0,0,1,0,110,1,2,0,0,1,0,-1.508,-1.299,-1.303,-1.316,-0.303,0.013,-0.961,-1.741,0.694,0.734,-0.284,0.831,5.564,3.309,-0.28,0.65
if you refer to other examples in countries like European countries like Germany,115,3,1,0,0,1,0,115,1,2,0,0,1,0,-1.421,-0.648,-0.968,-1.34,1.614,0.399,-0.716,-1.084,5.526,2.313,0.35,1.581,4.729,6.361,-0.391,-0.084
French Greece or turkey they actually face a lot of problems regarding their Refugee,120,3,1,0,0,2,0,120,1,2,0,0,1,0,-0.88,-1.029,-1.142,-0.834,-0.168,-0.042,-1.351,-1.32,-0.419,-0.613,-0.046,-0.589,2.51,4.964,-0.178,-1.055
because I think Germany and France and Greece,125,3,2,0,0,2,0,125,2,1,0,0,1,0,-1.069,-0.98,-1.343,-1.233,0.126,0.449,-1.677,-1.615,0.816,-0.508,0.41,0.882,5.573,5.534,0.149,0.304
have problems but how about turkey turkey is not actually they only put the,130,3,2,0,0,1,0,130,2,1,0,0,1,0,-1.388,-0.698,-1.126,-1.076,0.408,0.426,-0.065,-0.992,-0.448,0.386,0.031,0.306,4.226,4.257,-0.214,-0.313

they actually put a refugee in the candidate they actually warned that they got to release the refugee from the can,150,3,1,0,0,2,0,150,2,1,0,0,1,0,-1.141,-1.382,-0.998,-1.208,1.143,0.827,0.444,-1.235,-0.18,2.089,-0.858,0.602,1.707,1.995,-0.489,0.456
as a warning sign for like a kind of risk,155,3,2,0,0,2,0,155,2,1,0,0,1,0,-1.345,-1.024,-1.242,-1.235,0.512,0.06,-0.57,-1.548,-0.283,2.099,0.499,2.035,7.967,6.9,-0.379,-0.196
or a threat to the u.s. to the European Union so I believe that,160,3,2,0,0,2,0,160,2,1,0,0,1,0,-1.545,-1.495,-1.487,-1.395,-0.883,-0.919,-1.439,-1.817,-0.495,-0.364,-0.496,-0.572,2.923,2.065,-0.454,-0.239
they actually have to Refugee and they just use a lot of refugee at one of the threat but I think that's not,165,3,2,0,0,2,0,165,2,1,0,0,1,0,-0.916,-0.718,-0.626,-1.042,3.611,2.42,-0.241,-0.96,0.621,0.116,1.672,0.339,7.847,4.19,-0.033,1.252

but regarding the development of Korea I think that is,270,2,1,0,1,1,0,270,2,2,0,1,1,0,-1.474,-0.864,-1.397,-1.203,-0.122,0.271,-0.042,-1.499,-0.702,-0.607,-0.257,-1.013,3.068,1.418,-0.84,-0.956
it better to focus on Korean people first when you develop Korea because Korean people that,275,2,1,0,1,2,0,275,2,2,0,1,1,0,-1.406,-0.979,-1.124,-1.342,1.02,1.427,-1.295,-1.72,0.013,-1.076,0.247,-0.074,4.078,2.6,-1.379,-0.66
read the core resources of Korea like Korea hasn't is used to be a homogeneous country so,280,2,1,0,1,2,0,280,2,2,0,1,1,0,-0.74,-0.917,-0.848,-1.141,1.021,1.259,-0.984,-0.368,0.099,4.499,1.729,2.46,4.422,6.544,0.937,0.82
even with Korean people do they actually you guys actually was able to develop into,285,2,1,0,1,1,0,285,2,2,0,1,0,0,-1.437,-1.008,-1.292,-1.253,0.003,0.779,0.066,-1.179,0.821,3.171,0.878,0.278,8.852,4.31,0.852,0.891
one of the main power in the world so isn't keep focusing on Korean people,290,2,1,0,1,2,0,290,2,2,0,1,0,0,-1.556,-1.081,-1.082,-1.275,0.835,0.361,-0.506,-0.777,3.291,1.542,1.912,-0.232,5.629,5.146,-0.086,2.116
is one of the way to develop to develop Korea a better country,295,1,1,0,0,2,0,295,2,2,0,1,0,0,-1.4,-1.357,-1.28,-1.288,0.463,1.183,-0.173,-1.647,-0.383,-0.19,-0.485,-0.623,1.599,1.644,-1.527,-1.643
in the future and talking about Korean people actually do you the Yemen if Yugi,300,1,1,0,0,2,0,300,2,2,0,1,0,0,-1.248,-1.16,-1.259,-1.231,0.436,-0.376,-1.541,-1.696,-0.492,0.534,0.462,-0.248,3.65,1.192,-1.84,-1.319
in in Jeju Island actually cause a lot of trouble for Korean people like,305,1,1,0,0,2,0,305,2,2,0,1,0,0,-1.284,-0.965,-1.268,-1.28,0.903,0.36,-0.864,-1.763,2.19,2.23,2.565,0.99,10.097,12.133,0.054,1.196
the people who residing in Korea and they actually stick to seven cases of Korean,310,1,1,0,0,2,0,310,2,2,0,1,0,0,-1.546,-1.457,-1.399,-1.267,-0.375,-0.355,-2.452,-1.517,1.951,3.262,1.964,0.745,9.902,4.538,1.455,-0.163
woman who actually got adopted by Korean I buy the gemenese refugee,315,2,2,0,1,1,0,315,2,2,0,1,0,0,-0.703,-0.546,-0.48,-0.918,3.478,1.3,0.927,-0.011,2.398,2.409,3.833,1.587,9.667,9.657,1.016,1.841
so isn't it isn't it isn't it the focus of Korean people to protect is,320,2,1,0,1,1,0,320,2,2,0,1,0,0,-1.059,-0.51,-0.89,-1.138,0.952,0.164,0.029,-0.768,-0.727,0.503,1.246,0.574,8.329,6.101,2.308,0.129
is countrymen first instead of receiving those people from oversea,325,2,1,0,0,1,0,325,2,2,0,1,0,0,-1.139,-1.077,-0.318,-1.191,3.455,1.679,-0.264,-0.784,0.556,1.499,0.884,0.051,5.911,5.604,0.224,0.585

want to get the refugee and just in case that you need to have a real treatment like a huge amount of,335,2,1,0,0,1,0,335,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.149,-0.964,-0.595,-1.155,2.209,2.343,-0.249,-0.465,-0.386,1.398,0.309,-0.06,7.5,8.963,-0.289,-0.691
resources to actually build cam or actually have a proper way for,340,2,1,0,0,1,0,340,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.516,-1.38,-1.121,-1.213,0.875,1.376,-0.497,-1.406,1.278,5.865,4.075,0.709,7.255,10.501,0.646,0.259
the Yemen people to actually mingle with the Korean people because Korean is actually,345,2,2,0,0,1,0,345,2,2,0,0,1,0,-1.485,-0.516,-1.23,-0.988,0.29,0.207,-0.071,-1.317,-1.108,0.049,-0.661,-0.946,3.277,1.066,-1.282,-1.376

dumb by Muslims and Europe,125,1,2,1,0,0,0,125,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.508,-1.253,-1.378,-1.279,-0.152,-0.499,-2.185,-1.767,-0.315,0.316,0.365,-0.304,6.058,4.028,-0.019,-1.398
some fresh veggies are known for I'm not not,130,1,2,1,0,0,0,130,2,2,1,0,1,0,-0.817,-0.768,-0.886,-1.198,1.583,0.417,-0.506,-1.015,0.238,-0.414,1.624,1.486,3.088,2.448,-0.049,0.259
at not accepting the loss in Europe but try to force Islam,135,1,2,1,0,1,0,135,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.413,-1.368,-1.46,-1.34,-0.098,-0.142,-0.821,-1.604,-1.721,-1.656,-1.434,-1.447,-1.083,-1.12,-2.832,-2.107
so I think that because of be Muslim,140,1,2,1,0,1,0,140,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.295,-1.112,-1.171,-1.06,1.83,0.17,-1.445,-0.908,-1.389,-1.31,-1.007,-1.275,-0.435,-0.617,-0.851,-1.866
in our freezer area they should not allow that because,145,2,2,1,0,1,0,145,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.276,-1.239,-1.216,-1.205,0.309,-0.264,-1.403,-1.237,-1.446,-1.514,-1.059,-1.385,-0.572,-0.884,-2.908,-1.98
it can affect economy it can affect security of the people,150,1,2,1,0,1,0,150,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.481,-1.429,-1.421,-1.225,0.413,-0.219,-1.784,-1.485,0.905,0.613,0.276,-0.025,4.289,3.659,-0.977,-0.929
it can affect how people,155,1,2,1,0,0,0,155,2,2,1,0,1,0,-0.681,-0.167,-0.934,-0.988,1.426,0.962,0.27,-0.975,-1.717,-1.658,-1.565,-1.475,-0.612,-0.963,-2.884,-2.071
look,160,2,2,1,0,0,0,160,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.3,-1.273,-1.343,-1.148,0.627,0.086,-0.773,-1.745,-1.677,-1.366,-1.146,-1.36,-0.977,-0.916,-2.441,-1.956
the safeness of Corey as a whole,165,1,3,1,0,0,0,165,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.219,-1.082,-1.266,-1.249,1.076,0.387,-1.983,-1.127,-1.372,-1.435,-0.994,-1.257,-0.213,0.036,-2.003,-1.666
you have mentioned that because the the place,170,1,3,1,0,0,0,170,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.085,-1.274,-1.321,-1.145,0.197,-0.262,-1.069,-1.404,0.327,0.531,0.296,-0.048,1.591,2.154,-0.505,-0.537
where the refugee represents leaves is the place where tourists,175,1,3,1,0,0,0,175,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.496,-1.407,-1.374,-1.345,0.009,-0.512,-2.417,-1.758,-0.823,0.136,-0.898,-0.81,-0.44,-0.071,-0.453,-1.209
so it would be bad for the economy of Jeju Island but,180,1,2,1,0,0,0,180,2,2,1,0,1,0,-1.561,-1.525,-1.49,-1.367,-0.41,-0.473,-3.028,-2.07,-1.347,-0.856,-1.167,-1.103,-0.186,0.367,0.317,-1.422
I think that even even refugees can like help,185,1,2,0,0,0,0,185,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.569,-1.436,-1.498,-1.363,-0.446,-0.93,-1.871,-1.535,-1.45,-1.425,-1.384,-1.24,-0.682,-0.684,-0.382,-1.636
help to enhance the general economy for many reasons they can work during,190,2,2,0,0,1,0,190,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.56,-1.356,-1.536,-1.387,-1.016,-1.144,-2.994,-2.071,-1.545,-1.195,-1.174,-1.201,-0.315,-0.041,-1.581,-1.68
their stain Institute so it would promote did other economic something like,195,1,2,0,0,1,0,195,1,2,0,0,0,0,-1.232,-1.379,-1.324,-1.197,0.108,-0.458,-1.312,-1.398,-1.669,-1.671,-1.178,-1.43,-1.012,-1.247,-3.011,-2.112
a comic activity something like building a new apartment or some other places and there is even a,200,1,2,0,0,1,0,200,1,2,0,0,0,0,-1.525,-1.474,-1.449,-1.35,-0.153,-0.108,-2.608,-1.706,-1.618,-1.422,-1.13,-1.396,-0.766,-0.718,-1.726,-2.011
place which sells even he's food so like,205,1,2,0,0,1,0,205,1,2,0,0,0,0,-1.507,-1.515,-1.563,-1.344,-1.007,-1.193,-2.893,-2.045,-1.631,-1.658,-1.156,-1.372,-0.84,-1.006,-2.496,-1.983
it's it has become a hot place for tourists so there are many reasons,210,1,2,0,0,1,0,210,1,2,0,0,0,0,-1.207,-0.782,-1.248,-1.219,1.713,0.069,-1.352,-1.253,-0.782,0.17,-0.729,-0.849,1.046,1.848,-0.405,-0.328
that can refute that and for safety issue,215,1,2,0,0,0,0,215,1,2,0,0,0,0,-1.566,-1.368,-1.409,-1.323,-0.09,-0.517,-2.758,-1.991,1.64,0.337,1.476,1.183,10,6.861,1.191,-0.109
maybe because it can be worked because of the prejudice,220,1,2,0,0,0,0,220,1,2,0,0,0,0,-1.542,-1.278,-1.305,-1.332,1.833,-0.08,-2.543,-1.965,-1.452,-0.936,-1.318,-1.168,-0.743,-0.656,-0.745,-1.896
and think of Koreans for,225,1,2,0,0,0,0,225,2,3,0,1,0,0,-1.348,-1.172,-1.356,-1.274,0.387,-0.14,-2.515,-1.676,-1.524,-1.449,-1.528,-1.414,-1.144,-1.264,-0.418,-1.836
Muslim people so I think that it should be break down as soon as possible,230,1,2,0,0,0,0,230,2,3,0,1,0,0,-1.026,-0.986,-1.126,-1.025,0.653,0.678,0.474,-1.028,-0.732,-0.936,-0.928,-0.743,-0.631,-0.547,0.094,-1.7
Dimension,235,1,2,0,0,0,0,235,2,3,0,1,0,0,-1.093,-0.617,-1.147,-1.087,2.593,0.893,0.494,-0.79,-1.102,-1.073,-1.112,-0.927,-0.415,-0.351,-1.53,-1.716
work but as far as I know if they only,240,1,2,0,0,0,0,240,2,3,0,1,0,0,-1.352,-1.455,-1.491,-1.351,0.138,-0.563,-1.856,-1.101,-1.389,-1.143,-1.376,-1.156,-0.324,-0.953,-0.193,-1.799
there are only allowed to do minor jobs like pitching,245,1,2,0,0,0,0,245,2,3,0,1,0,0,-1.294,-1.295,-1.324,-1.281,0.613,-0.382,-2.2,-1.665,0.582,-0.935,-0.585,-0.203,7.217,3.483,-0.224,-1.228
working restaurant but that also can,250,1,2,0,0,1,0,250,2,3,0,1,0,0,-1.562,-1.544,-1.527,-1.31,-0.352,-0.997,-2.633,-1.976,-1.622,-1.363,-1.516,-1.231,-0.84,-1.064,1.097,-1.709
affect how people view that restaurant if they,255,1,2,0,0,1,0,255,2,3,0,1,0,0,-1.069,-1.49,-1.212,-1.162,0.436,-0.089,-0.487,-1.462,-0.426,-0.769,0.16,-0.447,2.292,1.284,-1.284,-1.395

because people from that area area,265,1,2,1,0,0,0,265,3,3,0,1,0,0,-1.359,-1.334,-1.402,-1.293,0.109,-0.294,-0.55,-1.292,-0.134,-1.051,-0.318,-0.928,3.955,4.372,-1.186,-1.678

that they make it is TRUE that it can be a corruption but I think it would be a dream for yourself,285,1,2,1,0,0,0,285,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.294,-1.024,-1.218,-1.188,0.288,-0.184,-0.518,-1.29,-1.577,-1.402,-0.734,-1.322,-0.337,-0.401,-3.046,-2.003
you that knows how many different area or in that area of the world,290,2,2,1,0,0,0,290,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.453,-1.249,-1.201,-1.282,-0.236,0.617,-0.835,-1.465,-1.5,-1.536,-0.694,-1.363,-0.41,-0.701,-3.03,-2.009

majority I don't think that they will attract to Jim and foot because it's not worldwide,300,1,2,1,0,0,0,300,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.505,-1.241,-1.424,-1.314,-0.29,-0.798,-2.69,-1.891,-1.537,-1.447,-0.612,-1.325,-0.514,-0.633,-2.597,-1.904
known like I don't know people who say oh I want him and feel so good,305,1,2,1,0,0,0,305,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.227,-1.416,-1.506,-1.351,-0.87,-1.227,-3.033,-2.068,-1.441,-1.497,-0.52,-1.308,-0.418,-0.393,-3.029,-2.052
is,310,2,2,1,0,0,0,310,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.521,-1.348,-1.393,-1.128,-0.284,-0.868,-1.774,-1.873,-1.581,-1.559,-0.672,-1.272,-0.197,-0.812,-3.044,-2.053
it is it all okay yeah for local IT jobs,315,1,2,1,0,0,0,315,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.391,-1.54,-1.531,-1.372,-0.651,-0.948,-2.445,-1.861,-1.55,-1.561,-0.863,-1.285,0.149,-0.616,-3.046,-2.103
for Jeju Island as I know like there are not many like young people who stays in,320,1,2,1,0,0,0,320,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.467,-1.399,-1.456,-1.305,0.054,-0.744,-2.762,-1.836,-1.583,-1.574,-0.47,-1.34,-0.178,-0.472,-3.049,-2.032
this room so like I think that there is a lot of demand,325,1,2,1,0,0,0,325,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.505,-1.379,-1.549,-1.38,-1.019,-1.18,-3.076,-2.058,-1.467,-1.568,-0.582,-1.393,-0.333,-0.806,-3.058,-2.046
for the local jobs that you mentioned something like the fishing and like it will,330,1,2,1,0,0,0,330,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.282,0.013,-1.135,-1.169,1.361,0.039,-1.076,-1.191,-1.505,-1.457,-0.763,-1.413,-0.571,-0.611,-3.027,-2.035
be possible to be adapted for some something like sports tennis,335,2,2,1,0,0,0,335,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.455,-1.429,-1.511,-1.327,-0.443,-0.591,-2.179,-1.822,-1.483,-1.406,-0.752,-1.325,0.377,-0.713,-2.944,-1.962
collecting tangerines or something like that so I think it,340,1,2,1,0,0,0,340,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.464,-1.334,-1.324,-1.201,0.053,0.382,-1.796,-1.818,-1.257,-1.561,-0.579,-1.287,-0.484,-0.539,-0.821,-1.781
means people can work at their and and you have,345,1,2,1,0,0,0,345,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.598,-1.611,-1.564,-1.362,-0.932,-1.046,-2.76,-1.786,0.371,0.627,2.117,1.004,15.136,14.534,1.502,1.119
there and continue living like this so it would be even,350,2,2,1,0,0,0,350,1,2,1,0,1,0,-0.903,-0.859,-1.31,-1.074,0.933,0.604,-1.1,-1.34,-0.711,-0.91,0.888,-0.657,5.237,11.599,-0.448,-0.73
but if we double for Jeju Island I think and secondly for the humanist book you mentioned,355,1,2,1,0,1,0,355,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.297,-1.481,-1.152,-1.354,1.119,0.117,-1.873,-1.663,-0.294,0.461,0.061,-0.304,5.992,3.087,0.192,-0.911
that this because this food is not popular among other people it would be,360,1,2,1,0,1,0,360,2,2,1,0,0,0,-0.718,-1.553,-1.279,-1.255,-0.542,-0.758,-2.288,-1.99,0.392,0.141,-0.085,0.473,4.227,4.353,-0.99,-0.165
not like effective as you think but I think that it can be,365,1,2,1,0,1,0,365,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.534,-1.429,-1.527,-1.411,-0.453,-0.792,-2.525,-1.852,-1.731,-1.662,-1.479,-1.466,-1.168,-1.304,-3.081,-2.131
one of the way to increase the multi diversity not only,370,1,2,1,0,0,0,370,2,2,1,0,0,0,-0.589,0.053,-1.103,-0.958,2.627,0.744,-0.154,-0.618,-1.459,-1.519,-0.568,-1.254,-0.214,-0.748,-2.744,-1.945
in for the Joyland like there's so many Muslim people who stays in,375,1,2,1,0,0,0,375,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.305,-1.075,-1.274,-1.213,-0.166,-0.471,-0.759,-1.371,-1.405,-1.353,-0.746,-1.321,-0.282,-0.306,-1.935,-1.815
Korea so like I think it can be like spread over many places and like it,380,1,2,1,0,0,0,380,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.412,-1.511,-1.359,-1.279,0.114,-0.454,-0.946,-1.46,-1.273,-1.474,-0.583,-1.22,-0.338,0.002,-2.21,-1.72
would be helpful for them to stay and work together,385,1,2,1,0,0,0,385,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.426,-1.455,-1.388,-1.155,0.545,-0.331,-0.203,-0.605,-0.914,-0.901,-0.941,-0.669,-0.445,0.17,-0.623,-1.128
yep for the minor job that they can do,390,1,2,1,0,0,0,390,2,2,1,0,0,0,-1.236,-1.374,-1.355,-1.145,0.34,0.016,-2.005,-1.594,-1.755,-1.68,-1.608,-1.484,-1.241,-1.393,-3.066,-2.151
is to that they can do it because they are young people that look for new house,395,1,2,1,0,0,0,395,1,2,1,0,1,0,-0.845,-1.259,-1.311,-1.144,0.529,0.461,-0.032,-1.113,-1.532,-1.464,-1.237,-1.335,-1.051,-1.069,-1.377,-1.851
stuff but by experience for example in,400,1,2,1,0,0,0,400,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.359,-1.351,-1.402,-1.242,0.321,-0.15,-0.705,-1.564,-1.009,-1.209,-0.887,-0.97,-0.714,-0.345,-1.49,-1.556
my country a chance to go to my country to look for a job but in the area they live in,405,1,2,1,0,1,0,405,1,2,1,0,1,0,-0.938,-0.895,-1.136,-1.159,0.649,0.459,-1.809,-1.012,-1.338,-1.519,-1.21,-1.246,-1.07,-1.218,-1.895,-2.029
they still have bad reputation even though they work hard and people don't,410,1,2,1,0,1,0,410,1,2,1,0,1,0,-0.984,-1.479,-1.304,-1.245,-0.18,-0.156,-0.727,-1.743,-1.663,-1.64,-1.318,-1.428,-0.93,-1.194,-2.253,-2.018
like to live in those area so what is fine because this area are,415,1,2,1,0,1,0,415,1,2,1,0,1,0,-0.914,-0.309,-1.178,-1.136,1.054,0.28,-1.503,-1.456,-1.504,-1.605,-1.001,-1.414,-0.892,-1.198,-1.907,-2.024
not tourist attraction but if they live they,420,1,2,1,0,1,0,420,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.21,-1.056,-1.315,-1.116,1.07,0.366,0.075,-0.925,-1.668,-1.63,-1.179,-1.451,-0.83,-1.208,-2.371,-2.113
will live in a resort area I think people might avoid that area,425,1,2,1,0,1,0,425,1,2,1,0,1,0,0.176,0.081,-0.197,-0.408,3.013,2.086,2.15,-0.75,-1.667,-1.625,-1.513,-1.433,-1.086,-1.278,-2.064,-1.988
and look for other options far front from there that's one point,430,1,2,1,0,1,0,430,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.506,-0.943,-1.334,-1.28,0.349,-0.434,-1.821,-1.136,-1.551,-1.472,-0.54,-1.299,-0.576,-0.881,-3.019,-2.041
second point is multiculturalism I agree with that,435,2,2,0,0,0,0,435,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.339,-1.053,-1.29,-1.305,-0.294,-0.444,-1.257,-1.298,-1.533,-1.519,-1.123,-1.364,-1.139,-1.109,-1.58,-1.064

resort places it will be bad for the tourists to come on Mason economic but I think that like if they are,490,2,2,0,0,1,0,490,1,2,1,0,1,0,-1.69,-1.505,-1.51,-1.399,0.053,-0.561,-2.789,-2.046,0.024,-0.461,0.631,-1.004,0.271,2.186,-2.082,-1.49

going to affect too much into the Korean economy and I think increasing,185,1,2,0,1,1,0,185,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.209,-1.036,-1.462,-1.18,-0.675,-0.68,-1.254,-1.137,-1.135,-1.125,-1.265,-1.196,-0.435,-0.212,-0.615,-1.659
it is it's not going to affect too much into the big scale of the,190,2,2,0,1,1,0,190,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.947,-1.155,-1.138,-1.027,0.464,-0.381,0.551,-0.379,-1.249,-1.254,-1.466,-1.24,-0.182,-0.855,-0.424,-1.298
Korean economy and also I have doubt that the,195,2,2,0,1,1,0,195,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.972,-0.991,-1.016,-1.053,0.365,-0.167,-0.398,-1.291,-1.41,-1.063,-1.331,-1.248,-0.031,-0.4,-0.97,-0.891
tourists is affected like tourists Jeju Island to is going to judge you island is affected,200,2,2,0,1,1,0,200,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.953,-1.085,-1.209,-0.98,0.715,0.596,0.164,-1.372,-1.327,-0.552,-1.348,-1.228,0.826,-0.436,0.645,-0.554
because there are more young people because again the numbers only 500 and also,205,2,2,0,1,0,0,205,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.51,-1.56,-1.499,-1.292,-0.292,-0.746,-1.52,-1.6,-1.278,-1.011,-1.519,-1.289,-0.43,-1.094,-1.151,-1.593
I think I heard also the case where,210,2,2,1,1,0,0,210,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.405,-1.379,-1.389,-1.25,-0.004,-0.553,-1.38,-1.17,-1.568,-1.436,-1.482,-1.331,-0.677,-0.879,-2.12,-1.858
there's a murder like a corpse is found and it's,215,2,2,1,1,1,0,215,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.364,-0.648,-1.074,-1.042,0.4,-0.14,-1.211,-0.965,-0.878,-1.052,-1.347,-1.227,-0.16,-0.687,-0.664,-1.705
like people are saying well this is because of the refugee and everything but it turns out to be FALSE so I think,220,2,2,1,1,1,0,220,2,2,0,0,0,1,-0.684,-0.898,-1.037,-1.15,0.547,-0.095,0.446,-0.193,-1.415,-0.973,-1.501,-1.224,0.129,-0.734,-0.716,-1.004
yeah many of these issues are blown out of proportion yeah,225,2,2,1,1,1,0,225,2,2,0,0,0,1,-1.285,-1.264,-1.376,-1.28,-0.661,-0.954,-1.464,-1.417,-1.097,-1.116,-1.311,-1.124,1.519,-0.15,0.038,-0.844
I think in a condemnation tore,230,2,2,1,1,1,0,230,2,2,0,0,0,1,-1.215,-0.59,-1.263,-1.068,-0.557,-0.43,-1.419,-0.159,-1.513,-0.744,-1.563,-1.372,-0.383,-0.992,-1.368,-1.729
them without any you know sort of justifiable reason is not acceptable and,235,2,2,1,1,1,0,235,2,2,0,0,0,1,-1.651,-1.438,-1.56,-1.381,-0.811,-1.055,-2.792,-2.009,-0.393,0.04,-1.309,-0.938,1.827,-0.14,-0.913,-0.46
you said it's a slow proportion and maybe it is,240,2,2,1,1,1,0,240,2,2,0,0,0,1,-1.579,-1.544,-1.476,-1.419,0.186,-0.435,-2.644,-2.029,-0.812,0.441,-1.33,-0.841,2.505,0.674,-0.005,-1.014
it is small portion proportionate absolute number but I think how,245,2,2,1,1,1,0,245,2,2,0,0,0,1,-1.643,-1.479,-1.568,-1.37,-0.711,-1.052,-2.508,-1.926,-1.042,-1.124,-1.379,-0.597,-0.873,-0.607,0.574,-1.276
people actually feel feel about the number is not small because Korea is,250,2,2,1,1,1,0,250,2,2,0,0,0,1,-1.676,-1.55,-1.57,-1.417,-0.604,-1.097,-2.875,-2.035,-1.213,-1.023,-1.456,-1.192,-0.5,-0.639,-0.563,-1.394
not really that Tidwell you know sort of like living together with people,255,2,2,1,1,1,0,255,2,2,0,0,0,1,-1.574,-1.532,-1.524,-1.415,-0.661,-1.127,-2.97,-2.018,-0.875,-1.073,-1.336,-1.073,-0.422,-0.798,-0.384,-1.091
from different cultures and all that so I'm not and also I read in the news article,260,2,2,1,1,1,0,260,2,2,0,0,0,1,-1.648,-1.591,-1.528,-1.405,-0.634,-1.087,-2.802,-2.075,-1.47,-1.37,-1.561,-1.249,-0.478,-0.958,-0.796,-1.633
that there are not like enough like shelter and like system systems I can,265,2,2,1,1,1,0,265,1,2,0,0,0,1,-1.441,-1.493,-1.51,-1.307,-0.896,-1.176,-2.175,-1.888,-1.431,-1.161,-1.457,-1.349,-0.466,-0.976,-1.227,-1.653
actually provide them provides them like comfort and safety,270,2,2,1,1,1,0,270,1,2,0,0,0,1,-1.623,-1.533,-1.482,-1.402,-0.39,-0.568,-2.968,-2.007,-0.963,-1.062,-1.263,-0.898,-0.092,-0.061,0.276,-1.184
so we should so maybe it's a small proportion but,275,2,2,1,1,1,0,275,1,2,0,0,0,1,-1.594,-1.597,-1.557,-1.433,-0.577,-0.879,-2.91,-2.041,-1.632,-1.459,-1.52,-1.35,-0.719,-1.066,-0.736,-1.872
for now everything is sort of drastic and too soon for Koreans to actually come up with,280,1,2,0,1,0,0,280,2,2,0,1,0,0,-1.496,-1.366,-1.458,-1.361,-0.037,-0.596,-2.921,-1.741,-1.144,-0.977,-1.448,-1.157,0.043,-0.628,-1.406,-1.073
a graph solutions to accept more people so I think maybe slowly accepting,285,1,2,0,1,0,0,285,2,2,0,1,0,0,-1.538,-1.571,-1.523,-1.412,-0.412,-0.803,-3.004,-2.082,-1.421,-1.372,-1.541,-1.348,-0.083,-0.748,0.63,-1.811
them is okay for people to actually get used to their culture and all,290,2,2,0,1,0,0,290,2,2,0,1,0,0,-1.497,-1.55,-1.407,-1.317,-0.572,-0.787,-3.028,-2.022,-1.378,-0.988,-1.452,-1.326,-0.562,-0.771,0.006,-0.267
that and sort of get over the you know hatred and fear to just you know kick,295,2,2,0,1,0,0,295,2,2,0,1,0,0,-1.558,-1.481,-1.537,-1.357,-0.782,-1.015,-2.801,-1.899,-1.394,-1.3,-1.444,-1.309,-0.601,-0.826,-1.224,-1.793
kick kick them out of the country so that is acceptable and,300,2,2,0,1,0,0,300,2,2,0,1,0,0,-1.623,-1.404,-1.531,-1.36,-0.512,-0.949,-2.986,-1.82,-1.157,-1.33,-1.494,-1.298,-0.268,-0.318,-1.077,-1.606
I I sort of agree with people fear because in cases,305,2,2,0,1,0,0,305,2,2,0,1,0,0,-1.61,-1.318,-1.493,-1.402,-0.833,-0.999,-2.094,-1.473,-1.51,-1.339,-1.443,-1.037,0.178,-0.244,-1.2,-1.265
like Germany Peach Germany actually assess accepted a lot of refugees,310,2,2,0,1,0,1,310,2,2,0,1,0,0,-1.607,-1.617,-1.524,-1.426,-0.411,-1.007,-2.93,-2.053,-1.366,-1.257,-1.518,-1.302,-0.604,-0.669,-0.234,-1.758

only 550 people so it is the first thing that I think,70,2,2,0,0,0,0,70,2,3,0,0,1,0,-1.137,-0.747,-1.114,-1.132,0.303,0.075,-0.812,-1.329,-0.957,-1.425,-1.317,-1.067,-0.481,-0.682,-0.933,-1.687
the Korean government should accept this group of refugees,75,2,2,0,0,0,0,75,2,3,1,0,1,0,-1.584,-1.14,-1.351,-1.368,-0.488,-0.682,-1.713,-1.819,-1.249,-1.254,-1.023,-1.095,0.161,0.277,0.046,-1.698
okay yeah that,80,2,2,0,0,0,0,80,2,3,1,0,0,0,-1.332,-1.19,-1.116,-1.263,-0.118,0.894,-2.553,-1.881,-0.858,-0.781,-1.155,-0.897,0.736,1.066,0.583,-0.797
I agree with you with that okay Korean just side of convention in 1991,85,2,2,0,0,0,0,85,2,3,1,0,0,0,-1.458,-1.56,-1.406,-1.325,-0.638,-0.788,-2.829,-1.91,-1.331,-1.009,-1.054,-1.164,0.473,-0.349,-0.096,-0.637
but I just think that it's like a special,90,2,2,0,0,0,0,90,2,3,1,0,0,0,-1.377,-1.086,-1.309,-1.043,1.634,1.329,-0.718,-1.467,-1.415,-1.076,-1.306,-1.18,-0.239,-0.135,-1.364,-1.402
case for the Koreans who have like their their bodies the is like with the,95,3,2,0,0,0,0,95,2,3,1,0,0,0,-1.253,-1.277,-1.315,-1.043,0.059,-0.438,-0.319,-1.591,-0.795,-1.303,-0.853,-0.968,0.651,0.217,-0.22,-1.187

so I think if you think about your population first and there are some so very that,105,3,2,0,0,0,0,105,2,3,1,0,0,0,-0.956,-1.112,-1.378,-1.084,-0.009,0.978,0.269,-1.298,-1.342,-1.445,-1.268,-1.141,0.515,-0.352,-2.152,-1.776
have or these away that there are more populous proportion of,110,3,2,0,0,0,0,110,2,3,1,0,0,0,-0.838,-0.74,-0.965,-1.186,1.564,1.269,0.596,-1.246,0.612,0.057,-0.747,-0.941,1.693,1.69,0.37,-0.536
Korean population so I just thing that if you just,115,3,2,0,0,0,0,115,2,3,1,0,0,0,-1.219,-1.466,-1.3,-1.106,1.536,1.413,-1.367,-1.21,-1.485,-0.752,-1.524,-1.266,1.456,0.412,-1.169,-0.925
do four follow the convention is,120,3,2,0,0,1,0,120,3,3,1,0,0,0,-1.251,-1.219,-1.295,-1.111,1.078,0.279,0.205,-0.898,-1.498,-1.334,-1.136,-1.164,0.344,0.041,-0.748,-1.869
not the best way to be the good just for the country,125,3,2,0,0,1,0,125,3,3,1,0,1,0,-0.593,-0.878,-1.074,-0.926,2.538,3.267,0.512,1.924,-1.42,-1.468,-1.303,-1.285,1.788,0.26,-0.915,-1.502
but you have to look and take care your place and also it was like,130,3,2,0,0,1,0,130,3,3,1,0,1,0,-0.989,-0.696,-1.006,-1.156,1.525,1.378,-1.287,-0.485,-1.261,-1.456,-1.296,-1.223,0.711,0.024,0.132,-1.552

in Japan so and many other like European countries it's mostly the middle,155,2,3,0,0,0,0,155,3,2,0,0,1,0,-1.407,-1.336,-1.367,-1.181,-0.453,-0.778,-1.843,-1.576,-1.461,-1.298,-1.361,-1.326,-0.023,-0.276,-0.341,-1.538
is two countries that have were and Refugee problem,160,2,3,0,0,0,0,160,3,1,0,0,1,0,-0.757,-0.943,-1.211,-1.175,-0.695,-0.902,-0.253,-1.413,-0.948,-1.004,-0.957,-0.917,2.626,1.65,-0.27,-0.815

one of the main reason that I disagree with accepting refugees is that,170,2,3,0,0,0,0,170,3,2,0,0,1,0,-1.087,-1.178,-1.223,-1.077,0.021,-0.864,-0.927,-1.177,-1.576,-1.45,-1.275,-1.376,0.037,-0.589,-0.588,-1.775
the problem in Yemen and many other countries that like Syria,175,2,3,0,0,0,0,175,3,2,0,0,1,0,-1.425,-1.527,-1.534,-1.345,-1.19,-1.273,-2.107,-1.587,-1.628,-1.421,-1.496,-1.378,-0.152,-0.438,-2.057,-1.954
it's mostly the problem of religion and,180,2,3,0,0,0,0,180,3,2,1,0,0,0,-1.673,-1.46,-1.537,-1.417,-1.106,-1.238,-2.461,-1.946,-1.401,-1.296,-1.422,-1.274,0.24,-0.151,-0.761,-1.197
so this religious problem is due to Islam and like Islam has mainly two,185,2,3,0,0,0,0,185,3,2,1,0,0,0,-1.655,-1.404,-1.526,-1.37,-1.061,-1.116,-2.668,-1.873,-0.988,-0.813,-1.156,-1.153,0.654,1.65,-1.878,-1.476

have yeah I mean yeah,275,2,3,0,0,0,0,275,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.687,-0.665,-0.72,-0.701,-0.057,-0.075,-1.458,-1.398,-1.433,-1.532,-1.265,-1.278,-0.71,-0.802,-2.948,-1.901
there,280,2,3,0,0,0,0,280,2,2,0,0,0,0,-0.548,-1.231,-0.507,-0.91,0.931,0.963,-0.174,0.055,-1.644,-1.61,-1.466,-1.376,-0.131,-0.762,-1.878,-1.95
is,285,3,3,0,0,0,0,285,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.201,-1.464,-1.432,-1.181,-0.903,-1.057,-0.931,-1.579,-1.38,-1.194,-1.147,-1.287,0.201,0.922,-1.272,-1.205
like so the first reason why disagree with accepting refugees,290,2,3,0,0,0,0,290,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.512,-1.198,-1.254,-1.174,-0.803,-1.073,-1.414,-1.92,-1.607,-1.502,-1.521,-1.405,-0.405,-0.783,-1.409,-1.729
as because of like many other Islamic countries are not accepting refugees,295,2,3,0,0,0,0,295,1,2,0,0,0,0,-1.182,-1.389,-1.489,-1.158,-0.786,-1.009,-2.217,-1.965,-1.102,-1.008,-1.164,-0.929,0.335,0.553,-0.941,-1.426
and the second reason is that like Islam is although it's,300,2,3,0,0,0,0,300,1,2,0,0,0,0,-0.49,-1.019,-1.072,-0.888,0.142,-0.52,1.075,-1.271,-1.184,-1.036,-1.118,-1.176,0.12,-0.33,-1.464,-1.376
getting a bit better Islam is still a very sexist religion,305,2,3,0,0,1,0,305,1,2,0,0,0,0,-1.493,-1.431,-1.481,-1.078,-0.802,-0.749,-2.164,-1.782,-1.415,-1.347,-1.25,-1.225,-0.173,-0.391,-1.732,-1.535
and and Islam woman is treated like,310,2,3,0,0,1,0,310,1,2,0,0,0,0,-0.468,-0.425,-0.609,-0.588,0.002,0.188,-1.042,-0.302,-1.141,0.558,-1.081,-1.094,1.365,1.053,0.111,-0.18
a property of man I think but when a man is speed refuges,315,2,2,0,0,0,0,315,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.53,-1.318,-1.453,-1.302,-0.816,-1.144,-2.63,-1.875,-0.885,-0.896,-1.003,-1.099,1.978,2.449,1.127,-0.843
come to Korea they still holds that idea in their mind and,320,2,2,0,0,0,0,320,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.374,-1.381,-1.434,-1.221,-0.53,-0.934,-2.181,-1.816,-0.97,-0.718,-1.208,-1.283,-0.268,-0.289,-1.876,-1.865
so before but then Korea accepted them before going through like,325,2,2,0,0,0,0,325,3,2,0,0,0,0,-1.561,-1.447,-1.428,-1.332,-0.82,-0.855,-2.807,-1.986,-0.848,-0.293,-0.945,-0.977,0.487,1.127,-1.438,-1.164
lecture like before educating them about why,330,2,2,0,0,0,0,330,2,2,0,0,0,0,-1.597,-1.257,-1.412,-1.335,-1.026,-1.027,-2.468,-1.917,-1.366,-1.285,-1.345,-1.089,0.114,-0.145,-1.602,-1.767
like man and woman should be treated equally and so with,335,2,2,0,0,0,0,335,3,2,0,0,0,0,-1.239,-1.027,-1.375,-1.072,-0.562,-0.885,-0.959,-1.366,-1.276,-1,-1.121,-1.323,1.571,0.128,-0.726,-1.694
that idea might that woman is a property of matter I,340,2,2,0,0,0,0,340,3,2,0,0,0,0,-1.673,-1.543,-1.6,-1.423,-1.081,-1.242,-2.528,-1.963,-1.109,-0.732,-1.203,-0.98,1.157,0.457,-0.934,-1.069
believe that many yemenis people who might cause of problems in Korea,345,2,2,0,0,0,0,345,3,2,0,0,0,0,-1.565,-1.449,-1.531,-1.385,-0.93,-0.693,-2.741,-1.958,-1.349,-1.143,-1.317,-1.223,-0.061,-0.204,-1.617,-1.885
in Jeju Island and yeah,350,2,2,0,0,0,0,350,3,2,0,0,0,0,-1.467,-1.192,-1.536,-1.303,-0.598,-0.656,-2.036,-1.732,-1.353,-1.033,-1.126,-1.011,1.319,1.113,-1.394,-0.965
I guess your prediction right that's TRUE,355,2,2,0,0,0,0,355,3,2,0,0,0,0,-1.392,-1.329,-1.231,-1.272,0.657,-0.349,-0.65,-1.736,-1.325,-1.32,-1.19,-1.148,1.258,0.068,-2.156,-1.816
so I mention that,360,2,2,0,0,0,0,360,3,2,0,0,0,0,-1.324,-0.92,-1.384,-1.177,0.162,-0.611,0.214,-1.404,-1.531,-1.583,-1.377,-1.313,-0.582,-0.848,-2.922,-1.981

and like my second reason was there's no reason why we the second reason and like my second reason was there's no reason why we,370,2,2,0,0,0,0,370,3,2,0,0,1,0,-1.514,-1.391,-1.405,-1.22,0.216,-0.589,-0.602,-1.47,-1.614,-1.278,-1.259,-1.32,-0.015,0.518,-1.248,-1.443

yemenis refugees haven't caused critical research paper so the prediction is,380,2,2,0,0,0,0,380,3,2,0,0,0,0,-0.764,-0.947,-1.324,-1.142,0.003,-0.482,0.496,-1.288,-1.315,-0.829,-1.014,-1.158,0.974,0.206,-2.29,-1.09
