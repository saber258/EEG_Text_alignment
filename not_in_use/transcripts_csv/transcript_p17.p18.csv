 first
 these refuges came from your men right and they left because the their country had to Terrors and
 regime was being
 these refugees came from your men right and they left because the their country at the Terrors and regime was being
 because they thought the country was dangerous after all and they have nowhere to go and Korea is a developed Nation also part of the United Nations I think they have the responsibility to take in the refugees
 because they thought the country was dangerous after all and they have nowhere to go and Korea is a developed Nation also part of the United Nations I think they have the responsibility to take in the refugees
 Es El Paso okay so I'm against the refugee letting the refugee into Jeju Island because first of all they are abusing The Immigrant love which is well first of all judges like a visa-free island so they can stay for 30 days but after that they have to go out but if they challenge for a trial at the court to let them in they can stay for additional 90 days and
 SL pasta okay so again is the refugee letting the refugee into Jeju Island because first of all they are abusing The Immigrant love which is well first of all judges like a visa-free island so they can stay for 30 days but after that they have to go out but if they challenge for a trial at the court to let them into can stay for additional 90 days and
 and of Korean government has to provide like food shelter and even for kids they have to provide Public Health Care and education so I think they're kind of abusing that system and second of all I think it's bit premature for both the refugees and Korean people to accept each other for example Yemen is in the Middle East so it's to the culture and like the food in general is
 and of Korean government has to provide like food shelter and even for kids they have to provide Public Health Care and education so I think they're kind of abusing that system and second of all I think it's bit premature for both refugees and Korean people to accept each other for example Yemen is in the Middle East so it's to the culture and like the food in general is
 different from Korea so
 different from Korea so
 for the Koreans it's hard to understand them and also for the young man is will be quite hard to settle down in Korea so yeah I didn't think there is responsibility for Korea to Lieutenant
 for the Koreans it's hard to understand them and also for the young man is will be quite hard to settle down in Korea so yeah I don't think there is responsibility for Korea to left I mean
 oh 2 points she said that they are reducing the law but the question of the debate is whether Korea should accept the refugees and therefore the law is not the issue if they're abusing the law we can change the law so that they can stay in more legally without using the side gates in the law and second you said that Koreans and Muslims are so different that it's it's not realistic that they live together but we have seen many cases in history like Germany and France
 okay Point she said that they are abusing the law but the question of the debate is whether Korea should accept the refugees and therefore the law is not the issue if they're abusing the law we can change the law so that they can stay in more legally without using the sides gates in the law and the second you said that Koreans and Muslims are so different that it's it's not realistic that they live together but we have seen many cases in history like Germany and France
 everything thousands of refugees and they have done well and in contrast Korea is only old as Korea only has to accept like 550 refugees which is a very small portion compared to what countries like Germany and France are doing and he said that Muslims will have difficulties settling in Korea but they don't have any choices they chose Korea because
 everything thousands of refugees and they have done well and in contrast Korea is only old as Korea only has to accept like 550 refugees which is a very small portion compared to what countries like Germany and France are doing and he said that Muslims will have difficulties settling in Korea but they don't have any choices they chose Korea because
 at least it's better than staying in their home country
 at least it's better than staying in their home country
 so
 so
 so I think the refugees don't have a choice and it's it's rather an obligation that they stayed here so for the first point of argument is that
 so I think the refugees don't have a choice and it's it's rather an obligation that they stay here so for the first point of argument is that
 they are abusing the law and so there was a petition to the blue house where the people were like change the law to not let the Immigrant in and so what the government did was to change the law and excluded your man from Visa free program so from now on except for those 550 people who are all already inside the Jeju Island over Yemen people can come in so from now on it
 they are abusing the law and so there was a petition to the blue house where the people were like change the law to not not let the Immigrant in and so what the government did was to change the law and excluded your man from Visa free program so from now on except for the 550 people who are all already inside the Jeju Island o Maryam and people can come in so from now on it
 illegal and second the Franks Germany and yeah I think they should let the immigrants in because when we think about all those crises originated from is from the colonial period when the European countries invaded Africa and set the ruler rulers in their own taste so they have like historical responsibilities to let immigrants in but for example Korea don't have any kind of those connections to military
 illegal and second difference Germany and yeah I think they should let the immigrants in because let me think about all those crises originated from is from the colonial period when the European countries invaded Africa and set the ruler rulers in their own taste so they have like historical responsibilities to let immigrants in but for example Korea don't have any kind of those connections to military
 Middle East Country so yeah I don't think there is I think rather than Korea maybe European countries who created all those meds should let those immigrants in
 Middle East Country so yeah I don't think there is I think rather than Korea maybe European countries who created all those meth should let those immigrants thing
 right you said that the law makes the refugees movements illegal but the question of the debate is whether that should be legal or illegal so whether the laws are illegal right now is irrelevant from this debate because that's what we are deciding right now whether we should change the laws so that refugees should be accepted into Korea and the second you said that France and Germany are different because they have historic ties to the Muslim countries but
 right you said that the law makes the refugees movements illegal but the question of the debate is whether that should be legal or illegal so whether the laws are illegal right now is irrelevant from this debate because that's what we're deciding right now whether we should change the laws so that refugees should be accepted into Korea and second you said that France and Germany are different because they have historic ties to the Muslim countries but
 but Korea also part of the United Nations has signed at the convention so they also have the international obligation to accept refugees when there is a crisis and also
 but Korea also part of the United Nations has signed at the convention so they also have the international obligation to accept refugees when there is a crisis and also
 Germany is certainly not accepting the refugees because they have historical responsibilities to Syrian refugees sexually though relationship is very weak between Syria and Germany it's not like Germany and Israel and so but they are accepting the refugees because that's the
 German is certainly not accepting the refugees because they have historical responsibilities to Syrian refugees sexually though relationship is very weak between Syria and Germany it's not like Germany and Israel and so but they are accepting the refugees because that's the
 that's the source that's the sort of behavior they must show as a developed country and Korea to is a developed country and it is very capable of accepting 550 refugees when countries like France and Germany are accepting 100,000 refugees every year so I think
 that's the so it's that's the sort of behavior they must show as a developed country and Korea to is a developed country and it is very capable of accepting 550 refugees when countries like France and Germany are accepting 100,000 refugees every year so I think
 refugees should be learning
 refugees should be learning
 so although they're like 550 people if you make exceptions for those if Yemen crisis that will fertile lead into other immigrants in the future which might probably more and more that's what that's how the European immigrant crisis started and also lots of European countries and lots of European countries most of most of the students are against the refugee because
 so although they're like 550 people if you make exceptions for those in Yemen crisis that will fertile lead into other immigrants in the future which might come in more and more that's what that's how the European immigrant crisis started and also lots of European countries and lots of European countries most of the most of the citizens are against the refugee because
 Alters bit different and they cause like social confusion so I think those kind of confusion will be even much larger in Korea because
 cauldrons bit different and they cause like social confusion so I think those kind of confusion will be even much larger in Korea because the culture itself is two different and also although there is no like confirmation that they actually create like a crime the people in Jeju Island feel like with anger from them even one of my friends who's from Georgia Island always talks about
 the culture itself is two different and also although there is no like confirmation that they actually create like a crime the people in Jeju Island feel like it's Anger from them even one of my friends who's from Georgia Island always talks about that thing and she sometimes though them and she doesn't want to see those people there so yeah I think if for the
 about that thing and she sometimes though them and she doesn't want to see those people there so yeah I think it's for the for the Yemen people yeah it is true that we should take care of them for a while but after the crisis settle down they should go back but I'm not sure whether they will try to stake in Korea even further because it is developed country yes I'm bit confused about that
 for the Yemen people yeah it is true that we should take care of them for a while but after the crisis settle down they should go back but I'm not sure whether they will try to take in Korea even further because it is developed country yes I'm bit confused about that
 well you have said that French and German people are against a refugees movements and that's because there are so many refugees moving into those countries every year it's about 100,000 refugees were talking about for European cases but for a career it's less than thousand and and I believe they fact of the refugees on Korean Society is much smaller compared to the effect that the refugees are bringing on to the European societies and therefore the
 well you have said that French and German people are against a refugees movements and that's because there are so many refugees moving into those countries every year it's about 100,000 refugees were talking about for European cases but for a career it's less than thousand and that and I believe they fact of the refugees on Korean Society is much smaller compared to the effect that the refugees are bringing on to the European societies and therefore the
 and objection will be lower as well and also we have to know that the judge island is a special case because once the refugees moving to the judge Island their economic activities will be limited to those in Jeju Island it will not affect the most parts of Korea and certainly we can therefore conclude that the effect of refugees and Korean societies very low and therefore all these objections against the refugees are very
 and objection will be lower as well and also we have to know that the judge island is a special case because once the refugees moving to the judge Island their economic activities will be limited to those in Jeju Island it will not affect the most part of Korea and certainly we can therefore conclude that the effect of refugees and Korean societies very low and therefore all these objections against the refugees are very
 exaggerated with they are based on baseless misconceptions that we Muslims are potential terrorists criminals and
 a glitch exaggerated with they are based on baseless misconceptions that Muslims are potential terrorists criminals and
 Korea now has to move from a society where it is misconceptions should no longer have effect on people's minds
 Korea now has to move from a society where these misconceptions should no longer have effect on people's minds
 okay so my think about that is that they're not limited to Jeju Island the Muslim people will actually there was a news report by Korean news agency that there was a Facebook group consisted of like 150 Yemen man and five Koreans were five Korean people were brokers who made like a sheep that led the German people moved to the Korean Mainland because at first the judges City whole tried to give
 okay so my think about that is that they're not limited to Jeju Island the Muslim people well actually there was a news report by Korean news agency that there was a Facebook group consisted of like 150 Yemen man and five Koreans were five Korean people were brokers who made like a ship that led the German people moved to the Korean Mainland because at first the judges City whole tried to give
 when people drop to the like the fisherman Tom to help the Fisher's catch the fish in the sea but they re they yeah at first they tried to do this job but they insisted that the wage is too low and they made a Facebook group and some of them actually went to Korea Mainland and there was on the news report so I don't think there will be confined to the Jeju Island and also although Korea is a developed developed country in
 and when people drop to the like the fisherman Tom to help the features catch the fish in the sea but they re they yeah at first they tried to do this job but they insisted that the wage is too low and they made a Facebook group and some of them actually went to Korea Mainland and was on the news report so I don't think there will be confined to the Jesuit Island and also although Korea is a default developed country in
 well well defined term I don't think it is developed country it is somewhere between the developing and developed country like there is like almost a double-double difference of an income for those European countries or United States so yeah I don't I don't think there is enough wealth for Korean government to support the future immigration but would you agree that at least Korea is more developed
 well well defined term I don't think it is developed country it is somewhere between the developing and developed country like there is like almost a double-double difference of an income for those European countries or United States so yeah I don't I don't think there's enough Wells for Korean government to support the future immigration but would you agree that at least Korea is more developed than
 Yemen that's true and would you agree that Korea is a more developed Nation who has signed the UN agreement for refugees has an international obligation to take in refugees yeah
 Yemen that's true and would you agree that Korea is a more developed Nation who has signed the UN agreement for refugees has an international obligation to take in refugees yeah
 then you agree that Korea has the obligation to take refugees and therefore it must take it are they fine for the UN immigration but that does not mean that they have to take them a I haven't read the UN Refugee act perfectly but the Korea doesn't have enough wealth to support
 then you agree that Korea has the obligation to take refugees and therefore it must take it are they fine for the UN immigration but that does not mean that they have to take them and I haven't read the UN Refugee act perfectly but the Korea doesn't have enough wealth to support the
 and then the current young people young Generations have don't have jobs so why should you use tax on them to support them while even the Korean people don't have enough jobs and even like the veterans who joined the Korean War skill
 and then the current young people young Generations have been have jobs so why should you use tax on them to support them while even the Korean people don't have enough jobs and even like the veterans who joined the Korean War still
 still living in poverty but before you agreed that Korea is a developed Nation compared to Yemen yeah would you agree that as a developed Nation it has capacity to take in at least 1,000 foreigners but Dad might lead into like potential crisis because those if we let those immigrants in they leak to Korean Mainland and even will further like the social problems larger
 still living in poverty but before you agreed that Korea is a developed Nation compared to Yemen yeah would you agree that as a developed Nation it has capacity to take in at least thousand foreigners but Dad might lead into like potential crisis because those if we let those immigrants in they leaked to Korean Mainland and even real for my social problems larger
 the news report said yeah so do you really believe that these 550 people pose real threats against 50 million Koreans because if we make exclusion for them even more young people will come to Korea because of that not even your man but even other Middle East and for example like South America Venezuela so if you make exclusion to the case it can future be a threat to Korean
 the news reports that yeah so do you really believe that these 550 people pose real threats against 50 million Koreans because it's being made exclusion for them even more young people will come to Korea because of that not even young man but even other Middle East and for example like South America Venezuela so if they make exclusion to the case if can future be addressed to Korean
 immigrant acts but certainly it will stop
 immigrant acts well certainly it will stop it here so
