and we'll start now so it isn't their third 338,000 Koreans now aged 25 to 34 is now unemployed so I think that the increased number of refugees that came to Korea will
and we'll start now so it isn't that certain 338,000 Korean now aged 25 to 34 is now unemployed so I think that the increased number of refugees that came to Korea will
 will affect more the unemployment of Korean than it is now so it is already hard for Koreans to find jobs but now the refugee will make the employment of foreign harder
 will affect more the unemployment of Koreans then it is now so it is already hard for Koreans to find jobs but now the refugee will make the employment of work harder

 but in my opinion career has been registered as the UN who accept refugees and there also and I think it's their responsibility to accept the refugees and about the
 but in my opinion Korea has been registered as the UN who accept refugees and there also and I think it's their responsibility to accept refugees and what the
 I can go like rather than work or office jobs they can do like labor I'm going
 I think they can do like rather than work or office jobs they can relax labor employment so yeah so I think
 yeah so I think it's fine


 but I think they can reconsider their decision because nowadays because of the war the infinite number of refugees increase like
 I agree but I think they can reconsider their decision because nowadays because of the war a number of refugees in Trace like
 552 that came to Jeju Island for the I saw Asylum so I think the government should reconsider their decision to accept because they have to think about the Korean first I think so that the they can make the country more
 552 that came to Jeju Island for the I saw Asylum so I think the government should reconsider their decision to accept because they have to think about the Korean first I think so that the they can make the country more
 wow they're in India of the that evil
 wow in your area of the table
 I'm just curious that where do you think the refugee should be taken
 I'm just curious that where do you think the refugee should be taking them
 well I mean where do you think the remedy should be taken if it's not pretty cool yeah you like you want to just shoot him asleep I don't have any friends but I think
 I mean they still have heart this children like no you have solution
 well I mean where do you think the refugee should be taken if it's not good yeah you like you want to just shoot them my sleep but I think I mean do you still do you have heart away like that I mean like no solution
 I think their own country so she'll provide the solution like they
 I think their own country so she'll provide the solution like they
 profile like a shelter for for the citizens
 like a safe shelter and so that they do not come to order another another country yeah I think that will be
 profile like a shelter for for the citizens a safe shelter so that they do not come to Under Armor ogre another country yeah I think that will be
 I'd better solution but there's like you know there's things like hunger or I can imagine what it would be but Korea has like their birth rate is getting lower and so like and they there are the number of foreigners
 I like yourself if there's like you know that countries do it under or I can't imagine what it would be but I recently read that Korea has like their birth rate is getting lower and lower and lower and so like and they there are the number of foreigners
 living here is also there's a showing of Ingress Ingress right so it's like I think Korea should start accepting that they are should be more exposed to International I mean like other other other people other everyone at this Korean guess like they start
 leaving here is also a showing of Ingress Ingress right so it's like I think career she'll start accepting that there should be more exposed to International I mean like other other other people other and we go like this Korean Goods like they started
 interest in Korean and also during which also curious one of the their destination for Refugee and that and also because of this issue actually like the the other parts of the world like the other countries see Korea is like resist or semicolon come here yeah so yeah I mean it's not good for Korea
 interest in Korean and also the Refuge also take curious one of the their destination for Refugee and and also because of this issue actually like the other parts of the world like the other countries see Korea is like resist or semi-public Community yeah so yeah I mean it's not good right for Korea
 you seem like that International outside of their country like you say that
 I'm like that International outside of their country like you say that there are already many foreigners that the already live here in Korea it's still a little but it increased little by little hey and now it with the number of refugees I think they're already a lot of foreigners and Koreans I think it's normal for
 there are already many foreigners that the already leave here in Korea it's still little but it increased little while ago hey and now it with the number of refugees I think they're already a lot of foreigners and Koreans I think it's normal for the people to protect their culture so that they don't mix with another Foreigner culture
 so you don't want to discriminate
 for the people to protect their culture so that they don't mix with another Foreigner culture right so you don't want to
 it is normal for two people to like protect first to protect your culture and then also I think they argue also about the safety of the Korean citizens like there's a killing or right only Korean woman speaking of safety
 I think they argue also about the safety of the Korean citizens like they're killing or re on the Korean woman speaking of safety it doesn't it doesn't guarantee that if this country only consist of
 it doesn't it doesn't guarantee that if this country only consists of real all these Koreans it very the safety because as you know there's a there are some cases like women being raped at Night by a little like the case in the how I think I heard the news about the and like people a woman being killed in real number is some some man
 real I mean all these Koreans it guarantee safety because as you know there is a there are some cases like women being raped at Night by like the case in Gangnam I think I heard the news about that like people a woman being killed in some man and then also the reason issue about the you know the spy cam that way
 and then also the reason issue about the you know the spy cam in the exact way so it doesn't even if it doesn't guarantee that this the Koreans also I mean just even just if there's only the screen and then doesn't guarantee safety so I think it's you can just have a stereotypical Prejudice of Outsiders to
 so it doesn't even if it doesn't guarantee that this the Koreans also I mean just even just if there's only discrete and then doesn't guarantee a safe thing so I think it's you can just have a stereotypical Prejudice of Outsiders to do like they're going to be like a terrorist or
 or like Wilderness or a criminals I think we yeah I don't think it's right to just judge someone just because we different oh yeah hey so
 to like they're going to be like a terrorist or or like being terrorists or criminals I think we yeah I don't think it's right to just judge someone just because we different just because we have for dinner yeah so
 but you but I think the the one that you should consider is the again the entry interest number of the refugee the 552 the keep increasing until now and also I think it will be more again in the next year than depending it's not the 500 people
 but you well I think the one that you should consider is the again the entry increased number of the refugee the 552 the keep increasing until now and also I think it will be more game in the next year 2020 it's not the 500 people
