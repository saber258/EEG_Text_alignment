5,0.8092494,time starts now okay so I think one of the major cons of letting them he's refusing to Korea is this idea of Koreans come first so if you look at the statistics the majority of the people who are against Emmys refugees were actually people in their twenties and thirties and middle-income individuals in the middle income class and this,0.88527411,0.700s,0.400s,time,1,en-us,29.977823s
66,0.89039356, okay so I think one of the major cons of letting the enemies of Jesus Korea is this idea of Koreans come first so if you look at the statistics the majority of the people who are against the Emmys refugees were actually people in their twenties and thirties and middle-income individuals in the middle income class and this is although this,0.88288432,3.100s,2.200s,okay,2,en-us,32.273016s
128,0.8219564, this is although this is a hypothesis this may stem from the fact that there's a high levels of youth unemployment so there is this concept of this idea that why are we letting these refugees come in and why are we spending taxpayers money on them when we should be focusing on other important issues that are more relevant to current people such as this idea of youth unemployment,0.91283858,30.100s,30s,this,1,en-us,55.214922s

261,0.79643089, yeah and also the second point is that because of the mass in flux so in 2015 there said there were no in no refugees but the number drastically increased so it also seems like they could potentially be taking advantage of the system or Korean Korean law,0.91283858,56.800s,56.300s,yeah,1,en-us,75.871657s
309,0.83483589, yeah and also the second point is that because of the mass in flux so in 2015 there said there were no in no refugees but number drastically increased so it also seems like they could potentially be taking advantage of the system or Korean Korean law,0.91283858,56.900s,56.400s,yeah,2,en-us,75.901724s

485,0.90929466, you know stripping from their rights to be safe and be educated and those kind of stuff and that's why they came to this country and not allowing them to stay in this country even though we actually made it into law that we could take them in b.o.b.,0.91283858,106s,105.900s,you,1,en-us,126.385944s

593,0.83295906, you know if he's trying to you know say that you're a nice person but only that be a facade right you're actually a bad person but not lying not for not allowing them to be in here and that was one of the basic human rights issues and the second point would be,0.91283858,130.700s,130.700s,you,2,en-us,149.818959s
647,0.84570718, you know if he trying to you know say that you're a nice person but only that be a facade right you're actually a bad person but not lying not for not allowing them to be in here and that was one of the basic human rights issues and the second point would be,0.91283858,130.800s,130.700s,you,1,en-us,149.828983s
701,0.89403677, Koreans are not letting them because they think they are racist and rapists and terrorists right but those things are not true since they ran away from that were they are the people who don't do not like violence so that's one of the main points that you could say that they don't do it like that,0.91283858,150.900s,150.500s,Koreans,2,en-us,169.603721s
758,0.84708571, fries are not letting them because they think they are racist and rapists and terrorists right but those things are not true since they ran away from that were they are the people who don't do not like violence so that's one of the main points that you could say that they don't do it like that,0.77189058,150.800s,150.500s,fries,1,en-us,169.613745s
815,0.7420519, okay so it's all your first point was that you couldn't tell me your first one again so people get it's a basic human rights issue of Koreans made a law that would allow them to come into the country to seek shelter although since they made the system right it they are basically allowing it but once it happens,0.91283858,171.800s,171.200s,okay,2,en-us,197.597055s
875,0.85067493, okay so it's our your first point was that you can you tell me your first one again so people get it's a basic human rights issue Koreans made a law that would allow them to come into the country to seek shelter although since they made the system right it they are basically allowing it but once it happens,0.91283858,171.800s,171.300s,okay,1,en-us,197.607079s
935,0.83726311, they're not allowing it allowing it so it's basically going against what they originally said they were going to so you're saying we don't want to be like controversial yeah basically what I'm trying to say well I think the ideal is good that deal of letting refugees into our country is good but for the case of the enemy's refugees seeing this mass in flux especially in Korea which is a much,0.91283858,198.100s,197.900s,they're,1,en-us,227.725220s
1008,0.8869459, they're not allowing allowing it so it's basically going against what they originally set their phones so you're saying you don't want to be like controversial yeah basically what you're trying to say well I think the ideal is good the idea of letting refugees in Turkey a country is good but for the case of the yemenis refugees seeing this Mass influx especially in Korea which is a much,0.91283858,198.100s,198s,they're,2,en-us,227.735241s
1078,0.72851712, other countries with much more linear resources that countries in like Europe or America could possibly be seen as threatening to the Korean people especially because it's only the island of JeJu and judge it was a very small part of Korea with a much more limited population so yeah yeah I guess I guess that's kind of true but you know the other point is that,0.91283858,227.900s,227.800s,other,1,en-us,252.591479s
1145,0.74472922, other countries with much more limited resources that countries in like Europe or America could possibly be seen as threatening to the community people especially because it's only the island of JeJu and judge it was a very small part of Korea with a much more limited population so yeah yeah and I guess I guess that's kind of true but you know the other point is that,0.75193661,227.900s,227.800s,other,2,en-us,252.601500s
1213,0.68087322, those yemenis are only 500 people right over the course of these years thousand North Korea's came to this country and you know if you think about that North Koreans are currently we're at War stating their these bad people you know according to like the 50s and 60s people they are these bad people with the other Notions and there they could they have the highest possibility of being spies right so in that kind of,0.37156737,253.600s,253.300s,those,1,en-us,282.980232s
1290,0.86115015, those yemenis are only 500 people right over the course of these years thousand North Koreans came to this country and you know if you think about that North Koreans are currently we're at War stating their these bad people you know according to like the 50s and 60s people they are these bad people with the other Notions and there they could they have the highest possibility of being spies right so in that kind of,0.91283858,253.600s,253.300s,those,2,en-us,282.990253s
1367,0.8932451, view yemenis they're only here to seek shelter they're not here to terrorize or anything like that in cats cats eat for see anything like that but North Koreans coming to this country for seeking shelter could be a bigger issue than that then why are we allowing North Koreans come here but not the yemenis,0.91283858,283.400s,283s,view,2,en-us,299.076647s
1423,0.90284401, view yemenis they're only here to seek shelter they're not here to terrorize or anything like that it can't cats eat for see anything like that but North Koreans coming to this country for seeking shelter could be a bigger issue than that then why are we allowing North Koreans to come here but not the yemenis,0.91283858,283.400s,283s,view,1,en-us,299.096695s
1480,0.89479756, well that is a good point on a human rights level the I think they could be viewed in the same way but from a Korean citizens perspective North Korea is still part of current it can still be viewed as an extension of Korea that was just simply divided because the war and especially because it was only a career isn't was only divided like 50 or 60 70 years ago,0.91283858,302s,301.400s,well,2,en-us,331.169256s

1626,0.87766528, we share the same language we have a very similar culture but for the yemenis I think it's possible that Korean citizens can do them as Outsiders and I think we should recognize the Korea is a country for Koreans and mutual respect the Korean citizens perspective of like,0.91283858,331.700s,331.500s,we,2,en-us,352.246943s

2294,0.78894544, I definitely do agree that that we shouldn't reject the enemies refugees because of this racist image but I think going Beyond racism it's more about national interests so each person in the world is part of a country there are citizens of a country and that that country has its own government and the government is supposed to work in the interest of his people and I don't think it's a bad thing that Korea,0.91283858,462.400s,462s,I,2,en-us,491.682410s
