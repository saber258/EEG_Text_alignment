 there are some problems in China and those people can like apply for being Korean refugees but then I don't know about any water or really just problems in Japan so and many other like European countries it's mostly the middle is to confuse that have were and refugees

 it's really just there is like so the first reason why disagree with accepting refugees is because of like many other Islamic countries are not accepting refugees and the second reason is that like Islam is a little its
 there is like so the first reason why disagree with accepting refugees as because of like many other Islamic countries are not accepting refugees and the second reason is that like Islam is although it's
 getting a bit better Islam is still a very sexist religion and Islam woman is treated
 getting a bit better Islam is still a very sexist religion and and Islam woman is treated
 like a property of man I think but when a man is speed refuges come to Korea they still holds that idea in their mind and so before but then Korea accepted them before going through like lecture like before educating them about why like man and woman should be treated equally and so with that idea
 like a property of man I think that when a man is Pete refugees come to Korea or they still holds that idea in their mind and so before but then Korea accepted them before going through like like you're like before educating them about why like man and woman should be treated equally and so with that idea
 might that woman is a property of matter I believe that many yemenis people who might cause of problems in Korea in Jeju Island and yeah
 mind that woman is a property of matter I believe that many yemenis who might cause a problem in Korea enjoyment and yeah it's your prediction right that's true so I mentioned that steak that issues in
 I guess your prediction right that's true so I mention that state that issues in

 second reason and like my second reason was there's no reason why we
 the second reason and like my second reason was there's no reason why we treat sorry the yemenis refugees haven't caused critical research paper so the prediction is that relation are in myself
 yeah and you compare Korea with
 33 the yemenis refugees haven't caused critical issues before so the prediction is that Nation are in myself yeah and you compare Korea with
 Isla country
 Isla countries yeah but
 Islam countries and in myself in my opinion it's one countries and Korea is different or different because eligius regions regions are Korea in Korea prepare have three right to choose any religion but in Islam countries they do
 Islam countries and in myself in my opinion it's one countries and Korea is different or different because Ali Just reaches regions of Korea in Korea people have free right to choose any religion but in Islam countries they don't
 they can't
 they can't and other primary her point of view
 and other primary bigger point of view
 there's very very different laws in each country yes so their country their cultures are different they're such thinking is different so that reason is the proper in myself
 there's very very different laws in each country yes so their country their cultures are different they're such thinking is different so that reason is the proper in myself

 I agree with your idea that like if there are refugees coming over to Korea because they were
 I agree with your idea that like if there are refugees coming over to Korea because they were treated unfairly did to their religion and other countries then I think like looking through the Korea does have a third of things about like who is Refugee who is considered a refugee and Chris not and after going through lead role
 treated unfairly due to their religion and other countries then I think like looking like Korea does have a set of things about like food is Refugee who is considered a refugee and who's not and after going your lead role and Rudi schools I think that if they are treated unfairly in religion then they should be accepted as Koreans I mean they should be
 I think that if they are treated unfairly in religion then they should be accepted as Koreans I mean they should be accepted in refugees as refugees in Korea but then these yemenis people or not that case like they do to Korea because of the war but then the problem is that the world was created like door was closed by the Islam's fighting over but then Korea is not an Islamic country so I believe
 in refugees as refugees in Korea but then these yemenis people or not that case like they do to Korea because of the war but then the problem is that the world was created like the war was caused by the Islam's fighting over but then Korea is not an Islamic country so I believe the Sinister Islamic other Islamic countries or the colors of the world so Islamic countries must be
 the since the Islamic other Islamic countries are the clothes of the world though Islamic countries must be
 like most have what's the most have some responsibilities of these refugees but then they're not taking any responsibility so like why does Korea have to take the responsibility
 like most high most have some responsibility of these refugees but then they're not taking any responsibility so like why does Korea have to take the responsibility
