0,okay so which I'm trying to argue against the yemeni refugees coming Korea I think the strongest point that I can make is practically speaking the resources high in South Korea is not big enough to take in any more foreigners and calligraphers so if they're coming for a tourist purpose they're actually being Spenders their customers so they're actually increase,30.278504s
1,okay so which I'm trying to argue against the yemeni refugees coming hurry up and think the strongest point that I can make is practically speaking the resources high and South Korea is not big enough to take in any more foreigners and for labor force so if they're coming for a tourist purpose they're actually being Spenders their customers so they're actually increase,30.298549s
2,resource pie with Korea but then the thing is these people are coming in as refugees he wants to be letting so labor force or thing is the unemployment rate in Korea is like 3% and then the young adult unemployment rate is shoots up to an eight point eight percent so that really means that young people are having a hard time finding jobs in other words I keep on going back to the point saying we don't have a large in a resource,59.203946s

4, so if we were to take in laborers,63.062676s
5, so if we were to take in laborers,63.072699s
6, we're sorting that they were taking away more of the pie which would even increase the crisis between young adults and the already employed labor force also then other point we can make is these people are looking for cheaper or they're looking for these simple laborers from people but then the thing is even that has become a problem within the current government because the lowest possible wage,92.158504s
7, we're sorting that I were taking away more of the pie which would even increase the crisis between young adults and the already employed labor force also then another point we can make is these people are looking for cheaper or they are looking for these simple laborers paying people for but then the thing is even that has become a problem within the current government because the lowest possible wage,92.168527s

10, so a lot of young people are trying to get into these cheap laborers to if he stays in other words they're practically is no bottom fruits that these refugees can get into and therefore don't have space for these people,112.684945s
11, so a lot of young people are trying to get into these cheap laborers to if these days in other words they're practically is no bottom foots that these refugees can get into and therefore you don't have space for these people,112.694967s
12, that's it,114.739593s
13, that's it for me,114.849842s
14, so I think I'm going to jump in right into what you just said and so basically the main point which is taken into account in some new source is that an employment in Korea is a problem I would say that it's mostly true but not really comparable to other developed countries such as most of the westerners country actually South Korea has one of the lowest unemployment rate,145.449072s
15, so I think I'm gonna jump in right into what you just said and stuff so basically the main point which is taken into account in some new source is that an ombre known in Korea is a problem I would say that it's mostly true but not really comparable to other developed countries such as most of the westerners country actually South Korea has one of the lowest unemployment rate and,145.459095s
16, it is to be considered that the unemployment rate is as I said a lot of manual jobs and as you can see in reports because it's missed mostly like talking about Jeju Island and all the furniture right so we are mainly talking about people that are escaping a crisis and what we can see is that on this seminar we have a lot of seminar mainly for example fishing jobs and cooking jobs,175.426895s
17, it is to be considered that the unemployment rate is as you said a lot of manual jobs and as we can see in reports because it's missed mostly like talking about Jeju Island all the foreigners right so we're Romania talking about people that are escaping a crisis and what we can see is that on this seminar we have a lot of seminar mainly for for example fishing jobs and cooking jobs,175.436918s
18, which are individual and cannot provide and for example like they have whole amount of maybe 500 refugees and over those 500 refugees or they already are the same they are about 170 170 jobs I think for fishing so there is I think there is definitely spots for those jobs that are in are no longer taking because these drugs are Maybe,205.444810s
19, which are individual and not occupied and for example like they have a whole amount of maybe 500 refugees and over those 500 refugees or they already had a seminar about 107 170 jobs I think for fishing so there is I think there is definitely spots for those jobs that Kareem are no longer taking because these drugs are Maybe,205.454833s
20, along your way from Seoul for example and long away from families and I think that it's more over something more humanitarian than economics even if the economics is to take into account and as I say I don't think you can imagine she's really proud,223.215014s
21, longer way from Seoul for example and long away from families and I think that it's more over something more humanitarian than economics even if the economics is to take into account and as I say I don't think economics is really fun,223.225037s
22, I'm really glad that you brought into other countries into point because when comparing these unemployment rates between countries it's also important to see what kind of humanitarian AIDS most basic humanitarian rights that they give for their Labour's and thing is in Western countries its poor even for the unemployed people they take care of these people who they have all these different humanitarian AIDS if you were to go to the state's you have the Health Equity,254.265264s
23, I'm really glad that you brought end all their countries into point because when comparing these unemployment rates between countries it's also important to see what kind of humanitarian AIDS most basic Humanity in right side they give for their Labour's and thing is in Western countries it's even for the unemployed people they take care of these people who are they have all these different humanitarian AIDS if you were to go to the state's you have the health language,254.275287s
24, well those of being bashed by Trump of bed but then the thing is it's still there and then in the EU you have these this inter connect enter Europe human health policy that insures these people how every other that's not really true because unless you're actually a Korean citizen not really getting all these three basic insurances so these foreigners,284.373382s
25, all those of being bashed by Trump of bed but then the thing is it's still there and then in the EU you have these this inter connect enter Europe human health policy that insures these people I live in Korea that that's not really true because unless you're actually approved citizen not really getting all these three basic insurances so these foreigners,284.373383s
26, and although he's unemployed people they're not really getting insured in Mattoon ways but you and that's because we don't have enough tax money if that's something that comes from the text and it's hard to ensure these people and then second novel like people escaping crisis well the humanitarian argument yes you could make it but then I like to ask what kind of practical,311.153972s
27, and all those unemployed people you're not really getting insured imagine ways but you and that's because we don't have enough tax money I think that's something that comes from the text it's hard to ensure those people and then second of all like people escaping crisis well the humanitarian argument yes you could make it but then I'll like to ask what kind of practical,311.153973s
28, benefit doll is being humanitarian Going to the Country,315.744358s
29, benefit doll is being humanitarian bring to the country,315.774425s
30, so we can think of all the examples such as States bringing people from South America now they're dying that to and the reality European Refugee crisis which now is bringing a lot of terrorism and fights within the state of Europe as I mean not a lot but then there's still help me it's increased from the form,338.165084s
31, so we could think of other examples such as this States bringing in people from South America now they're powering that to and then we have the European Refugee crisis which now is bringing a lot of terrorism and fights within the state of Europe as I mean not a lot about them is still happening it's increased from before,338.205173s
32, I would like to take them say the last part which is mostly the first construed the major blood I think the whole question of you humanitarian needs more about what you want to be as a country and what you want to represent as you go to more than adding and subtracting numbers of Economics I would say like for example so scary,372.182045s
33, I would like to take them say the last part which is mostly the first construed and two major flood I think the whole question of you humanitarian needs more about what you want to be as a country and what you want to be presented as you go through your more than adding and subtracting numbers of Economics I would say like for example so scary,372.182046s
34, signing letters convention Accords just cheap that the country's somehow bound to respect even if a lot of countries are not respecting those and I would sing that it's a bit difficult to not being human humanitarian considering Yemen position themselves to your position because like for example people in Yemen didn't choose to start in the end of the like right,402.159868s
35, Simon lot of convention Accords just she that the country's somehow bound to respect even if a lot of countries are not respecting those and I would think that it's a bit difficult to not being you mean humanitarian considering Yemen position themselves to be our position because like for example people in Yemen didn't choose to start in Yemen with their life right,402.159869s
36, and so if they would start to Korea they would have the Korean mushroom tea and everything that comes with it so it's kind of Epic buyers to sing by on the numbers and the last part is about comparing refugees for example even if Korea is not Dutch learn and even if there's a lot of problem we're basically comparing something that is not comparable I would say because it's for attention is somewhere near 1 million people in,432.177783s
37, and so if they would start to North Korea they would rush home fee and everything that comes with it so it's kind of Epic buyers to sing by on the members and the last part is about comparing refugees for example even if Korea is not Dutch loan and even if there's a lot of problem we're basically comparing something that is not comparable I would say because it's for directions somewhere near 1 million people in,432.177784s
38, people will get gems around for maybe 500 people so I would say and the last part about terrorism I guess it's a bit I'm a bit biased because I come from Europe but I would say that despite everything we can hear you definitely not true 382 diversion,454.217648s
39, people will get gems around for maybe 500 people so I would say in the last spoke about terrorism I guess it's a bit I'm a bit biased because I'm from Europe but I would say that despite everything we can hear you let me see not true 382 diversion,454.337919s
40, so he for not really feeling scared like they're not really feeling concerned about the whole therapy thing and yeah they are concerned that the link between immigration and terrorism is a bit more difficult than for example in France most of the people that one doesn't are Arts was actually French people it's French national TV people so it's not the Yellowjackets I guess but then before that there were Terror,484.846945s
41, so people are not really feeling scared like they're not really feeling concerned the whole therapy thing and yeah they are concerned but the link between immigration and terrorism he's a bit more difficult than for example in France most of the people that went on there are parks was actually French people it's French national tea people so it's not the Yellowjackets I guess but then before that there were Terror,484.877014s
42, isn't helped by jihadists sharing some sort of like super extreme Islam yeah Belinda in the u.s. you mean or internally then they are all the terrorist act we had except one or two were done by people that aren't French or Belgian nationality okay that's the same that not a lot of people know,508.871300s
43, is impelled by jihadists Sherry's destroyed super extremism yeah believe it in the u.s. you mean or inference then there are all the terrorist act we had except one or two were done by people that are French or Belgian nationality okay that's the thing that not a lot of people know well like point so first like you're here to point about the global convention,514.824768s
44, well the coin so our first like you're here to point about the global convention which is like there's a un from acts that I've several countries agreed on to take in refugees first of all the thing is strictly speaking this is not a person yeah you enact is like so agreement between countries that it's going to be cool if you do this but then you don't really have to so it's an on enforcing act therefore there is no global,539.219963s
45, which is like there's a un from acts that several countries that you don't take in refugees first of all the thing is strictly speaking this is not influencing yeah you enact is I can so agreement between countries that it's going to be cool if you do this but then you don't really have to so it's an on enforcing act therefore there's no Global there it doesn't it's not a global agreement between all these countries therefore we're not going to,544.842683s
46, look at that it doesn't it's not a global agreement between all these countries therefore we're not going to receive any,546.045405s
47, Denis,546.285948s
48, harm for doing so,550.074521s
49, laundry doing so good,550.254928s
50, okay and then the other thing is Korea is already taking an annual number of refugees from North Korea so although it's not comparable to the one to push them but the thing is if you put on a ratio of how many people are in the country and how many refugees are picking and it's actually comparable and then since we're taking already taking in that much refugees each year adding 500 more may look like not more but then considering that our unemployment rate has it's already a,582.006766s
51, okay and then the other thing is Korea is already taking in an annual number of refugees from North Korea so although it's not comparable to the money Bushland but the thing is if you put on a ratio of how many people are in the country and how many refugees are picking and it's actually comparable and then since we're taking already taking in that much refugees each year adding 500 more may look like not more but then considering that our unemployment rate has it's already a,582.056878s
52, percent,582.808578s
53, percent,582.818602s
54, and they were taking in though I already hands handful of refugees 500 is enough to tip the citizens,591.057242s
55, and they were taking in the early hands plant love refugees 500 is enough to tip the citizens,591.087309s
56, and to conclude I would say that to kind of state of if refugees are good or bad we should look at which country is the most culturally and economically powerful even if in some point could be say that you're trying to access to u.s. u.s. is really well known to be countries of immigrants I would say that if they are Miniature deliberately more power than if managed correctly yes,622.548489s
57, then to kind of conclude I would say that to kind of state of if refugees are good or bad we should look at which country is the most culturally economically powerful even if in some point it could be said that it's China X2 us universities really well known to be the countries of England's I would say it each day are managed correctly they bring more power than if managed correctly yes,622.799057s
58, okay it is over there,628.802640s
59, it is over now,628.872797s
