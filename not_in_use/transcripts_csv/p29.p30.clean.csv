1036,0.69311047, it is normal for two people to like protect first to protect your culture and then also I think they argue also about the safety of the Korean citizens like there's a killing or right only Korean woman speaking of safety,0.91283858,369.700s,369.600s,it,1,en-us,394.392297s
1077,0.7189759, I think they argue also about the safety of the Korean citizens like they're killing or re on the Korean woman speaking of safety it doesn't it doesn't guarantee that if this country only consist of,0.72095615,376.600s,376.500s,I,2,en-us,401.698827s
1113,0.83547622, it doesn't it doesn't guarantee that if this country only consists of real all these Koreans it very the safety because as you know there's a there are some cases like women being raped at Night by a little like the case in the how I think I heard the news about the and like people a woman being killed in real number is some some man,0.91283858,395s,394.800s,it,1,en-us,424.610665s
1180,0.83225226, real I mean all these Koreans it guarantee safety because as you know there is a there are some cases like women being raped at Night by like the case in Gangnam I think I heard the news about that like people a woman being killed in some man and then also the reason issue about the you know the spy cam that way,0.91283858,402.600s,402.200s,real,2,en-us,431.977331s

1303,0.85834426, so it doesn't even if it doesn't guarantee that this the Koreans also I mean just even just if there's only discrete and then doesn't guarantee a safe thing so I think it's you can just have a stereotypical Prejudice of Outsiders to do like they're going to be like a terrorist or,0.91283858,432.500s,432.300s,so,2,en-us,458.687762s
