the time I'll start okay so I'm against the integration of refugees to Korea so my main point is I 3 main points firstly I think it's important to take care of the Korean Nationals first and then look after the refugee refugees I know it's a great thing to help other people and the gospel
 others but I think it's more important to look after our people first so if we look at an example of since breathtaking refugees is kind of a big boundary if we look this into small boundary I think we can compare it with a family so let's say the young family was ten children and I'm not that wealthy and some of the children are getting enough food and some aren't some are getting a good education but some are we
 others but I think it's more important to the cost to our people first so if we look at an example of since breathtaking refugees is kind of a big boundary if you look this into small towns I think you can compare it with a family so let's say the young family with 10 children and I'm not that wealthy and some of the children are getting enough food and some aren't some of them good education but some are really
 the education at have a bad environment for upbringing but just because
 education I have a bad environment for upgrading but just because
 other wealthy families are taking adopting children adopting is a great thing to do on this thing help children and it's great but
 other wealthy families are taking adopting children adopting is a great thing to do on these things have children and it's great but
 would it be good to take in children adopt children when you can't even take care of your own children properly
 with the good to take in children adult children when you can't even take care of your own children properly
 I think it's the best thing is to take care of our children fifth and then look after others
 so I think it's best thing is to take care of our children Fist and then look off balance
 so that's my first point and my second point is that the people are mainly Muslim and it's not to do with race and not being I'm not being racist in the fact that
 so that's my first point and my second point is that the people are mainly Muslim and it's not to do with race I'm not being I'm not being racist in the fact that
 I think it's to do with the cultural thing and okay so if I'm I'm for immigration I guess so let me just address your first point about taking care of Korean Nationals first so yeah Korea should take care of their Nationals as well but just because you know
 I think it's to do with the cultural thing and okay so if I'm I'm for immigration I guess so let me just address your first point about taking care of Korean Nationals first so yeah Korea should take care of their Nationals as well but just because you know
 having refugees who are applying for jobs that it could go to Koreans doesn't necessarily mean that they're not taking care of Koreans in a way because what if those what if Koreans don't want those jobs than all those small menial jobs would just send go to refugees and in a way it would help Korean society and just because creating stomach creating Nationals are poured that's not the fault of the government maybe it's the fault of the of the person of the
 having refugees who are applying for jobs that it could go to Koreans doesn't necessarily mean that they're not taking care of Koreans in a way because what if those what if Koreans don't want those jobs than all those small menial jobs would just then go to refugees and in a way it would help Korean society and just because creating some creating Nationals are poor that's not the fault of the government maybe it's the fault of the of the person of the
 LOL it's maybe their own motivation that they lost so that they can't find a job they can't take care of themselves
 LOL it's maybe their own motivation that they lost so that they can't find a job they can't take care of themselves
 and also for a second point I think I have an idea of where you were going and to be honest Muslims are actually considered one of the religions that is very well respected and culturally they keep a lot of ground rules but those people extremists are the ones who don't stick to those rules and want to add more rules of their own to that religion so it's not necessarily religious wise
 and also for the second point I think I have an idea where you were going and to be honest Muslims are actually considered one of the religions that is very well respected and culturally they keep a lot of ground rules but those people extremists are the ones who don't stick to those rules and wanted to add more rules of their own to that religion so it's not necessarily religious wise
 and I think that Korea as a homogeneous society should actually become a little bit more heterogeneous and more of a cultural Melting Pot like other First World countries yeah I think that's it so yours you said that the poor people in Korea are the fault of their own and it's not the government that's what you said and I agree that some people in might be the case for some people that
 and I think that Korea as a homogeneous society should actually become a little bit more heterogeneous and more of a cultural Melting Pot like other First World countries yeah I think that's it you said that before people in Korea are the fault of their own and it's not the government that's what you said and I agree that some people in might be the case for some people but
 I was brought up in the UK and he the situation will be different there they are still poor people in Britain but the government helping the poor people is extremely different from Korea and Britain I think the government isn't doing enough to help the disabled or the
 I was brought up in the UK and the situation will be different there is still poor people in Britain but the government helping the poor people is extremely different from Korea and victim I think the government isn't doing enough to help the disabled or the


 old people yo people eventually he'll Etc and people who need help from the government who can't sustain the
 old people old people and eventually he'll Etc and people who need help from the government who can't sustain the can't help themselves who need help I think that the government needs to help them more and I'm you said that extreme people add more rule to the religion do you have you study the Cora have you studied
 can't help themselves through need help I think that the government needs to help them more and and you said that extreme people add more rule to the religion do you how do you study the Koran have you studied Muslim religion because I studied the religion because in the UK this is in GCSE we select subjects and I selected religion
 religion because I studied the religion because in the UK this is in GCSE we select subjects and I selected religion and I learned about Muslims and the Quran and the Quran I can't quote the crumbs I can't remember the exact words but it says to kill non-muslims and kill the gays kill the
 I'm that about Muslims and the Quran and the Quran I can't cook the crumbs I don't remember the exact words but it says to kill non-muslims and kill the gays kill the tried convert everyone to Muslim if they don't convert kill them and go to a different country and marry their people and have as many children
 try to convert everyone to Muslim if they don't convert kill them and go to a different country and marry the people and have as many children and I make them all Muslim and the guy from Muslim and if you kill someone because of religion you go to heaven okay Reba McEntire okay first I'll address your welfare
 children and they make them all Muslim and attack on Muslims and if you kill someone because of the religion you go to heaven okay rebuttal time okay first I'll address your welfare comment yeah so I think I would agree with you maybe you came would have a better welfare situation and comparisons to Korea right
 comment yeah so I think I would agree with you maybe you came would have a better welfare situation and comparisons to Korea right because Korean government doesn't really do doesn't really care about the disabled disabled or mentally challenged all the older generation and I agree with that but that's all in the government instead of actually protesting against
 because Korean government doesn't really do doesn't really care about the disabled disabled or mentally challenged all the older generation and I agree with that but that's all in the government instead of actually protesting against immigration they should actually be protesting for you know rights for welfare status fixing everything helping the mentally disabled helping the people helping the older generation maybe with pension or well first
 raishin they should actually be protesting for you know rights for welfare status fixing everything helping the mentally disabled helping the people helping the older generation maybe with pension or welfare status that's what they should be fighting for instead of immigration as well for a religion otherwise just because the coroner says to kill non-muslims it's like the Bible they're like Stone everybody who is a sinner or stone people who don't who's not Christian
 that's what they should be fighting for instead of immigration as well for a religion wise just because the coroner says to kill non-muslims it's like the Bible they're like Stone everybody who was a sinner or stone people who don't who's not Christian do they still them know it's just for Morality know they do Christians Stone them no Chris no but what about days of building
 they still don't know it's just for her alligator no way to Christian Stone them no Chris no but but what about this Showcase of buildings Stone women who don't wear the hijab that's only the extreme extreme ignore how do you know they're only the extremist why isn't there any Christian extremist who do that throw stones at the case kill
 this Stone women who don't wear the hijab that's only the extreme and extremist ignore how do you know they're only the extremist why isn't there any Christian extremist who do that throw stones at the gays kill
 people who commit adultery it says in the Bible to kill Stone but that's only a morality thing yeah to Christians are some of your morality did you see American Muslims killing with non-muslims know you don't that would be an everyday occurrence in America exactly so I don't think it's all they're not all of them follow
 people who commit adultery it says in the Bible to kill Stone but that's only a morality thing yeah to Christians as some of your morality did you see American Muslims killing with non-muslims know you don't that would be an everyday occurrence in America exactly so I don't think it all but not all of them follow
 but are they actually call themselves Muslims or do they call themselves another word for their terrorist group it depends they call themselves Muslims
 but are they actually call themselves Muslims or do they call themselves another word for their terrorist group it depends they call themselves Muslims
 so you're saying that terrorist people don't call themselves Muslims some don't some were just a group that there were an activist are trying to defend their own country and then they ended up getting the support of America and they became this huge terrorist groups like for example Isis
 so you're saying the terrorist people don't call themselves Muslims some don't some were just a group that there were an activist are trying to defend their own country and then they ended up getting the support of America and then they became this huge terrorist group like for example Isis

 so how is Isis so huge where is happening make money they got their first support from the US and then when Saddam Hussein died they go bigger how did they grew bigger where did they get all the equipment the weapons they got the Weaponry from the America before before said I was saying died so they got all the weapons before silencing and they're still have those weapons yeah and then they sell was weapons being fine
 so how is Isis so shoot wearing because they make money they got their first support from the US and then once that I'm Hussein died they go bigger how did they grew bigger where did they get all the equipment the weapons they got Weaponry from the America before before said I was saying died so they go all my weapons before silencing and they're still have those weapons yeah and then they sell those weapons being funny baking fall
 they gain followers followers make - definitely a huge support from some certain government and most people assume that it's from Saudia Arabia now it's prob maybe Saudi Arabia but in the beginning are why is Sandy Arabia supporting the Isis
 definitely a huge support from some certain government and most people assume that it's from Saudia Arabia now it's probably maybe Saudi Arabia but in the beginning it was why is that your labia supporting the Isis
 because the Muslim Brotherhood the Muslim idea what Isis is doing is the doing exactly what the Quran is they're saying then what is a bomb their own mosque
 because the Muslim Brotherhood the Muslim idea what Isis is doing is they're doing exactly what the Quran is very saying then what is a bomb their own mosque
 they didn't bomb their own laws they terrorized their own walk and it's not like every Muslim is a terrorist and everything was good I never said every Muslim is a terrorist I'm saying terrorists are Muslim but not every Muslim is a terrorist
 they didn't bomb their own laws they terrorize their own walk and it's not like every Muslim is a terrorist if everyone's I'm saying terrorists are Muslim but not every Muslim is a terrorist
