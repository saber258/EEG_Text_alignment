8, Es El Paso okay so I'm against the refugee letting the refugee into Jeju Island because first of all they are abusing The Immigrant love which is well first of all judges like a visa-free island so they can stay for 30 days but after that they have to go out but if they challenge for a trial at the court to let them in they can stay for additional 90 days and,62.761996s

10, and of Korean government has to provide like food shelter and even for kids they have to provide Public Health Care and education so I think they're kind of abusing that system and second of all I think it's bit premature for both the refugees and Korean people to accept each other for example Yemen is in the Middle East so it's to the culture and like the food in general is,93.000410s

14, for the Koreans it's hard to understand them and also for the young man is will be quite hard to settle down in Korea so yeah I didn't think there is responsibility for Korea to Lieutenant,108.886351s
15, for the Koreans it's hard to understand them and also for the young man is will be quite hard to settle down in Korea so yeah I don't think there is responsibility for Korea to left I mean,108.886351s
16, oh 2 points she said that they are reducing the law but the question of the debate is whether Korea should accept the refugees and therefore the law is not the issue if they're abusing the law we can change the law so that they can stay in more legally without using the side gates in the law and second you said that Koreans and Muslims are so different that it's it's not realistic that they live together but we have seen many cases in history like Germany and France,140.918823s
17, okay Point she said that they are abusing the law but the question of the debate is whether Korea should accept the refugees and therefore the law is not the issue if they're abusing the law we can change the law so that they can stay in more legally without using the sides gates in the law and the second you said that Koreans and Muslims are so different that it's it's not realistic that they live together but we have seen many cases in history like Germany and France,140.918823s
18, everything thousands of refugees and they have done well and in contrast Korea is only old as Korea only has to accept like 550 refugees which is a very small portion compared to what countries like Germany and France are doing and he said that Muslims will have difficulties settling in Korea but they don't have any choices they chose Korea because,168.611476s

21, at least it's better than staying in their home country,172.039231s
22, so,173.743086s
23, so,173.793199s
24, so I think the refugees don't have a choice and it's it's rather an obligation that they stayed here so for the first point of argument is that,188.025399s
25, so I think the refugees don't have a choice and it's it's rather an obligation that they stay here so for the first point of argument is that,188.035422s
26, they are abusing the law and so there was a petition to the blue house where the people were like change the law to not let the Immigrant in and so what the government did was to change the law and excluded your man from Visa free program so from now on except for those 550 people who are all already inside the Jeju Island over Yemen people can come in so from now on it,218.594561s

31, Middle East Country so yeah I don't think there is I think rather than Korea maybe European countries who created all those meth should let those immigrants thing,261.180911s
32, right you said that the law makes the refugees movements illegal but the question of the debate is whether that should be legal or illegal so whether the laws are illegal right now is irrelevant from this debate because that's what we are deciding right now whether we should change the laws so that refugees should be accepted into Korea and the second you said that France and Germany are different because they have historic ties to the Muslim countries but,292.431614s

38," that's the source that's the sort of behavior they must show as a developed country and Korea to is a developed country and it is very capable of accepting 550 refugees when countries like France and Germany are accepting 100,000 refugees every year so I think",343.497148s

42, so although they're like 550 people if you make exceptions for those if Yemen crisis that will fertile lead into other immigrants in the future which might probably more and more that's what that's how the European immigrant crisis started and also lots of European countries and lots of European countries most of most of the students are against the refugee because,376.622092s
43, so although they're like 550 people if you make exceptions for those in Yemen crisis that will fertile lead into other immigrants in the future which might come in more and more that's what that's how the European immigrant crisis started and also lots of European countries and lots of European countries most of the most of the citizens are against the refugee because,376.782455s
44, Alters bit different and they cause like social confusion so I think those kind of confusion will be even much larger in Korea because,388.388713s
45, cauldrons bit different and they cause like social confusion so I think those kind of confusion will be even much larger in Korea because the culture itself is two different and also although there is no like confirmation that they actually create like a crime the people in Jeju Island feel like with anger from them even one of my friends who's from Georgia Island always talks about,406.599915s
46, the culture itself is two different and also although there is no like confirmation that they actually create like a crime the people in Jeju Island feel like it's Anger from them even one of my friends who's from Georgia Island always talks about that thing and she sometimes though them and she doesn't want to see those people there so yeah I think if for the,419.007988s
47, about that thing and she sometimes though them and she doesn't want to see those people there so yeah I think it's for the for the Yemen people yeah it is true that we should take care of them for a while but after the crisis settle down they should go back but I'm not sure whether they will try to stake in Korea even further because it is developed country yes I'm bit confused about that,436.617830s
48, for the Yemen people yeah it is true that we should take care of them for a while but after the crisis settle down they should go back but I'm not sure whether they will try to take in Korea even further because it is developed country yes I'm bit confused about that,436.748124s
49," well you have said that French and German people are against a refugees movements and that's because there are so many refugees moving into those countries every year it's about 100,000 refugees were talking about for European cases but for a career it's less than thousand and and I believe they fact of the refugees on Korean Society is much smaller compared to the effect that the refugees are bringing on to the European societies and therefore the",468.439826s

51, and objection will be lower as well and also we have to know that the judge island is a special case because once the refugees moving to the judge Island their economic activities will be limited to those in Jeju Island it will not affect the most parts of Korea and certainly we can therefore conclude that the effect of refugees and Korean societies very low and therefore all these objections against the refugees are very,498.457740s
