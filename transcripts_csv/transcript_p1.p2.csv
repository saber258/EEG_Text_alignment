all right first one the state for this accepting this refugees arrived in this especially in many Arab Jesus arrived in Jeju Allah first of all I want to mention that the current movement in South Korea against against this year many refugees are pretty much standard phobic activity
Aurora I first want to state for this accepting this refugees arrived in this is Bachelor you many refugees has arrived in Jeju Island first of all I want to mention that the current movement in South Korea against against this year many refugees are pretty much standard phobic activity
 because right now those refugees are arrived and those refugees arrived in Jeju Island and are under intense examination of whether they are really lawful refugees and their Korean law or not and of course since they well at least they're claiming that they are fleeing from those conflicts and persecution and we all know that Yemen has currently undergoing this Civil War and we
 because right now those refugees are arrived and those refugees arrived in jjl and and are under independent examination whether they are really lawful refugees under Korean law will not and of course since they well at least they're claiming that they are fleeing from those conflicts and persecution and we all know that Yemen has currently undergoing this Civil War we all
 I know that if I call it says they do have some threats in their own country and yeah we have to of course we have to examine the fact that whether they are really facing thus those threats by themselves in their Nation by person by person but it's all they guaranteed or is their right to be examined fairly under those under those posts
 that by Common Sense they do have some threats in their own country and yeah we have to of course we have to examine the fact that whether they are really facing thus those threats by themselves and their Nation by person by person but it's all they guaranteed or is their right to be examined very under those under those processes
 asses and loss
 stand loss for for Korea being under the UN Refugee Convention as they've just signed they like several tens of years ago they create do have an obligation to fairly examine and if they are lawful but if you have to accept it
 for for Corey F being under the UN Refugee Convention as they just signed a like cyber tens of years ago they create do have an obligation to fairly examine it and if they are lawful wear it if you have to accept it


 yeah
 so overall I like against this accepting the refugees currently in Jeju largely because a lot of the population is not agreeing to it or accepting it already seven hundred thousand people signed a petition to the blue house against accepting the refugees and
 so the overall against this accepting the refugees Furniture Jew largely because a lot of the population is not agreeing to it or accepting it already seven hundred thousand people signed a petition to the blue house against accepting the refugees and
 the difference I guess when you're talking about xenophobia is there already 2 million foreigners leave living illegally in Korea right now the reason people are against it would be more because these people without visas cannot be accounted for but their actions the country itself because it seems such turmoil it cannot take responsibility for these people therefore they're more reluctant to accepting these people
 the difference I guess when you're talking about xenophobia is there already 2 million foreigners living illegally in Korea right now the reason people are against it would be more because these people without Jesus cannot be accounted for for their actions the country itself because it's in such turmoil it cannot take responsibility for these people therefore the more we looked into it accepting these people
 so it's hard to say is racist or xenophobia data to and this there's this General lack of trust of the Korean government especially for the young adults that the Korean government is not particular of its own citizens so it should pay more attention and make sure that it does not own citizens don't feel that the treatment towards refugees are unfair compared to the people who have
 so it's hard to say is I had a racist or xenophobic attitude and this there's this General lack of trust of the Korean government especially for the young adults that Korean government is not able to take care of its own citizens so it should pay more attention and make sure that it does not own citizens don't feel that the treatment towards refugees are unfair compared to the people who have
 the nationality and will have citizenship of the country already
 the nationality will have citizenship of the country already





 first of all you mentioned that s okay so well you mentioned that a lot of Korean citizens are against it and as a as an Evidence you showed the petition that number of the petitioners in foreign against these refugees but I believe this issue is not really a democratic issue that can be decided upon the popular Theory
 first of all you mentioned that s okay so well you mentioned that a lot of Korean citizens are against it and as a as an evidence to show the petition that number of the petitioners and for I mean against peace refugees but I believe this issue is not really a democratic issue that can be decided upon the popular Theory
 votes it is the legal right to be examined under a fair and Justice law because it is a law we I mean it is also kind of an International Love Me Korea sign like several tens of years ago and we promise to the international society that we are going to accept the refugees in this or that cases so well I do understand a lot of people are against the well there are a lot of like emotional or
 votes it is the legal rights to be examined under a fair and Justice law because it is a law and we I mean it is also kind of an International Love Me Korea sign like several tens of years ago and we promise to the international society that we are going to accept the refugees in this or bad cases so well I do understand a lot of people are against well there are a lot of like emotional or
 emotional or personal personal feelings against these refugees or in general against work for foreigners coming in the country but well I think that's not really the issue in this case and
 emotional or personal personal feelings against this refuges or in general against this or for foreigners coming in the country but well I think that's not really the issue in this case and also also well
 and also also well
 you also mentioned that they're already legal legally residing two million foreign people in South Korea and what I want what I just want to mention is that they're not illegal immigrants are just under a process so well it's not really it's really hard to say very illegal he's just in the in between that process in between those fetuses and well
 you also mentioned that there are already legal legally residing two million foreign people in South Korea and what I want what I just want to mention is that they're not illegal immigrants they're just under a process so well it's not really it's really hard to say very illegal you just in the in between that process of in between those statuses well
 you also mentioned about the responsibilities that the South Korea doesn't hold the responsibility to take care of this refugees but well let's go back to the represent convention and we do have a responsibility for that right so repeatedly you've mentioned the law but the agreement that tree has signed impact in 1994 which is more than 20 years ago and what we
 you also mentioned about the responsibility that the South Korea doesn't hold the responsibility to take care of this refugees but well let's go back to the refugee convention and we do have a responsibility for that right so repeatedly you mentioned the law the the agreement that Korea has signed impact in 1994 which is more than 20 years ago and what we
 but I want to point out is that if this law signed and if this was supposed to become an issue the government should not be responsible to educate the people prior to this disagreement happening so at this point people are not ready to accept the people although the government has taken the choice to sign the agreement the general population was not aware and the failure of the government to
 but I want to point out is that if this law is signed and if this was supposed to become an issue the government should have been responsible to educate the people prior to this disagreement happening so at this point people are not ready to accept the people although the government has taken the choice to sign the agreement the general population was not aware and the failure of the government to
 YouTube operation
 educate the population
 does not give it the right to just go forward and do what they have done in the past but the young gender generation of we're not aware of this issue and since back in 1994 over 33,000 refugees had applied but only 2.4 percent were accepted
 does not give the right to just go forward and do what they have done in the past because the younger generation of we're not aware of this issue and since back in 1994 over 33,000 refugees had apply but only 2.4 percent were accepted
 and right now the if the numbers were maintained there was no problem in maintaining that particular acceptance rate if he applied that acceptance rate to the current situation there should be no more problem although there's a sudden influx or so that incoming of the large number at this year last year
 and right now the if the numbers were maintained and since there was no problem in maintaining that particular acceptance rate if he applied that acceptance rate to the current situation there should be a normal problem although there's a sudden influx or so that incoming of the large number at this year last year
 we cannot accept more than what he had done previously without a safe angry life
 we cannot accept more than what he had done previously without a safe family life




 all right so well yeah I do agree we do in in a sense that since we have already signed their confession the government holds the responsibility to educate at least people about these conventions and are the country's responsibility International Society about refugees yeah I mean because because government lacks that I think that this kind of problem happens inside
 all right so well yeah I do agree we do in a sense that since we have already signed the confession the government holds the responsibility to educate at least people about these conventions and the are the country's responsibility International Society about refugees yeah I mean because because government lacks that I think that this kind of problem happened is that furry
 yeah well besides that
 well besides that
 you mentioned about rate of the two point two point four percent of the acceptance rate well I want to mention a little bit different view point of this
 you mentioned about rate of the two point two point four percent of their acceptance rate well I want to mention a little bit different Viewpoint of this
 well you said that it is really irregular death sudden influx of Romanian refugees in 2000 wait like 18 was really an irregular but well in general refugees don't have a choice of whether they want to go this country or that country just have an urge to escape their country and usually in that process they apply for the contactable curse and the book wasn't just a signpost
 well you said that it is really irregular does sudden influx of Romanian refugees in 2000 wait like 18 was really an irregular but well in general refugees don't have a choice of the whether they want to go this country with that contagious have an urge to escape their country and usually in that process they apply for the conduct of Brokers and the book was just assigned also
 okay I'll get this money and you just go that country so well it's not really their choices of arriving to judge you Allen and in that case we do have to consider the humanitarian and their Refugee status and Refugee status legally and lawfully in South Korea
 okay I get this money and you just go that country so well it's not really their choices of arriving to church you Allen and in that case we do have to consider the humanitarian and their Refugee stages because Refugee status legally and lawfully in South Korea



 so once again the
 so once again the
 we repeat the point that there was a sudden increase of from 41 people to over 500 people refugees suddenly coming to Korea although we have maintained a very low make the acceptance rate and the Brokers should have been aware of that however they did not take responsibility in your in your case according to what you mentioned so it's these people don't have a choice but so does Korea Korea
 we repeat the point that there was a sudden increase of from 41 people to over 500 people refugees suddenly coming to Korea although we have maintained a very low maintenance acceptance rate and the Brokers should have been aware of that however they did not take responsibility and your case according to much attention so it's these people don't have a choice but so does Korea Korea
 it's not ready for accepting me more than two point four percent at the moment because currently again once again we have not had strict policies about higher acceptance rates or in case of sudden a incoming of a large number of people in the general population was not aware
 it's not ready for accepting the more than two point four percent at the moment because currently again once again we have not have strict policies about higher acceptance rates or in case of sudden a incoming of a large number of people in the general population was not aware


 we are doing everything that is legal in terms of examining the people and making sure that the right people but you cannot say that the attitude of
 unpreparedness it's wrong and that this is the natural reaction of the people in Korea you have to accept that
 I think someone here are you
 we are doing everything that is legal in terms of examining the people and it gives her that are the right people but we cannot say that the attitude of unpreparedness is wrong and that this is the natural reaction of the people in Korea and we have to accept that take some of your are you
 okay so well since this is my final remarks I just want to mention it briefly about the whole argument of myself so I do think that we have to accept more I mean at least in this case you have to accept or after the thorough examination we have to accept this Romanian refugees arrived in Jeju Island and well of course as I mentioned over and over again it's all based on
 I don't we can start up right now okay so well since it's my final remarks I just want to mention briefly about the whole argument of myself so I do think that we have to accept more I mean at least in this case you have to affect or after the thorough examination you have to accept this Romanian refugees arrived in judge Allah and well of course as I mentioned him over and over again it's all based on
 Refugee Convention as we have signed in 1994 it is our promise to the international Society at that we are going to accept the refugees then it is also it's not really one-sided it's intervene a fishery for example if something happens in Korea and if Korean people is case South Korea for areas of different reasons about the threats well we redo it's packed that other nations who scientists
 Refugee Convention as we have signed in 1994 it is our promise to the international society that we are going to accept the refugees and it is also it's not really one-sided it's in turbine a fishery for example if something happens in Korea and if Korean people is case South Korea for various of different reasons about the threats well we do expect that other nations who scientists
 fashion except ourselves as a refugee and just like we may accept this your minion work which is right now in the southern coast of 2018 so yeah I do urge them you have to assign more and more research has to this Romanian refugees at least and of course it should be all based on the legal legal boundary we have to examine their urgent needs and whether they are really in threat in there
 fashion except ourselves as a refugee and just like we may accept this Romanian refugees right now in the summer of 2018 so yeah I do urge that we have to assign more and more research has to this Dominion refugees at least and of course it should be all based on the illegals legal boundary we have to examine their urgently stand whether they are really in threat in there
 but yeah in that process those refugees should be guaranteed those humanitarian issues like they're eating sand clothing staff also lawful and fair processes
 but yeah in that process those refugees should be guaranteed those humanitarian issues like their meetings and clothing staff also lawful and fair processes


 all right overall once again I want to repeat that I'm against accepting the refugees currently in Jeju for entering America and although the Korea Korea has signed a petition the agreement to accept refugees in the past but the nation itself decides how much how many people enter the country and it has done a very well good job mate
 all right overall once again I want to repeat that against accepting the refugees currently in Jeju for entering America and although the Korea Korea has signed the petition the agreement to accept refugees in the past but the nation itself decides how much how many people enter the country and it has done very well good job men
 meaning the low number considering its monocultural society and the single race mess of Korea and how it is like
 I mean bubble number considering its monocultural society and the single race - of Korea and how it is like
 it is balancing is trying its best to balance the amount of effort and research has gone into the
 it's balancing trying its best to balance the amount of effort and resources gone into the own citizens compared to the foreigners for entering without prior notice and they're doing its best to balance out and currently the conditions are not on that
 own citizens compared to the foreigners for entering without prior notice and they're doing its best to balance out and currently the conditions are not that you want to be able to fully take care of the refugees in large amounts so we are not ready yet to accept them in Korea
 I want to be able to fully take care of the refugees in large amounts so we are not ready yet to accept them in Korea and once the refugee Center they should also accept the consequences that are Korean government has such a limited
 once the refugees enter they should also accept the consequences that are Korean government has set to Unlimited

 okay experience is over now
 Sprint is over now
