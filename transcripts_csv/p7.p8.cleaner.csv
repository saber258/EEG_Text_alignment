1,start so I'm gonna brush from the article we assigned it 0.13 the 21 convention direct with Russia act which basically stated that pretty well except for Fisheries unlike many of the other Asian countries that did not sign it and I think it's very important to create keeps up with this promise that it's becoming more and more International lies and there's a reason why I said they would,30.168254s
2,choose in which case I think signifiers that we are ready for it first of all both financially and culturally and to suddenly turn our backs on these refugees who are in Desperate situations when they're coming into our country to flee their Civil War is very hypocritical and against the words that Korea should be keeping it with International Community,52.568934s

4, and I think it's very important to emphasize that the number of bring you many refugees are coming in is when you about founder 15 which is very small compared to other countries which mentioned like Germany which I understand is in a different situation but even so it is still very small compared to a lot of other countries for accepting many were refugees from many diverse backgrounds,74.829298s

22, that these people are usually looking for lower and jobs which in my opinion is actually complete opposite of what the Millennials or the younger generation are looking for because someone people who graduate from college they're looking for usually high on jobs that pay well they will get them ready for the society for marriage for example and I said immigrants are actually filling the void in which the younger generation are very reluctant to take so I believe that this will actually serve as a good opportunity for them and in order if the,311.224132s
