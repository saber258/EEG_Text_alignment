19, I think I heard also the case where there's a murder like a corpse is found and it's like people are saying well this is because of the refugee and everything but it turns out to be false so I think yeah many of these issues are blown out of proportion,241.967441s
20, yeah I think in a condemnation tore them without any you know sort of justifiable reason is not acceptable and you said it's a slow proportion and maybe it is it is small portion proportionate absolute number but I think how people actually feel feel about the number is not small because Korea is not really that,271.905174s
21, yeah I think you know condemnation tore them without any you know sort of justifiable reason is not acceptable and you said it's a slow proportion and maybe it is it is small portion proportionate absolute number but I think how people actually feel feel about the number is not small because Korea is not really that acquainted with you know sort of like living together with people,274.911977s
22, Tidwell you know sort of like living together with people from different cultures and all that so I'm not and also I read in the news article that there are not like enough like shelter and like system systems I can actually provide them provides them like comfort and safety so we should so maybe it's a small proportion but for now everything is sort of drastic and too soon for Koreans to actually come up with a graph,301.882997s
23, from different cultures and all that so I'm not and also I read in the news article that there are not like enough like shelter and like system systems I can actually provide them provides them like comfort and safety so we should so maybe it's a small Port proportion but for now everything is sort of drastic and too soon for Korean sexually come up with resolutions to accept more people so I think,304.889800s
24, solutions to accept more people so I think maybe slowly accepting them is okay for people to actually get used to their culture and all that and sort of get over the you know hatred and fear to just you know kick kick kick them out of the country so that is acceptable and I I sort of agree with people fear because in cases like Germany Peach Germany actually assess accepted a lot of refugees,331.900912s
25, think maybe slowly accepting them is okay for people to actually get used to their culture and all that and sort of get over the you know hatred and fear to seeing a kick kick them out of the country so that is acceptable and I I sort of agree with people fear because in cases like Germany P Germany actually assess accepted a lot of refugees and you know like cases where like,334.907715s
26, you know like cases where like people from Siberia like mert like right Germany girls like saying that it's like Collective rate like called tacos so sort of cases they that people get from Korean people get from like news sort of threatens and so you I think it's I think it's it's bad to just you know blame them without any reason but I also I think I can under as a Korean,362.029076s
27, people from so I really like Merck like right Germany girls like saying that it's like Collective rate like called tacos so sort of cases they that people get from Korean people get from like news sort of threatens them so you I think it's I think it's it's bad to just you know blame them without any reason but I also I think I can under as a Korean I can understand that people fear,365.075969s
28, and understand that people fear so yeah that kind of tragic incident happened and it's very sad but I would say that it's very underrated cases and usually the media is the one to blame which like blow it out of proportion so that people get to fear Foreigner Foreigner are raping girls and everything,392.006899s
29, okay so yeah that kind of tragic incident happened and it's very sad but I would say that it's very underrated cases and usually the media is the one to blame which like blow it out of proportion so that people get to fear Foreigner Foreigner are raping girls and everything so again I think the,395.735334s
30, thing so again I think the task of Korean government and Korea and educated people are too yeah to educate general public that this these are not the case this this this case are just minority is just not really because these people need help immediately something like that so that and also okay so you mentioned that accepting the,422.024814s
31, of Korean government and Korea and educated people are too yeah to educate general public that this these are not the case this this this case are just minority is just not really because these people need help immediately something like that so that and also okay so you mentioned that accepting them eventually will be okay but looking from the post,425.713157s
32, eventually we'll be okay but looking from the posters and the protest that people people bring paper saying fake refugees and everything I doubt that if there is no change Korean like this professor will change their attitude toward foreigners so I don't really buy that even making like more making slower effort to accept refugees to Korea would change people at,452.002637s
