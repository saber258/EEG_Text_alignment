2, because right now those refugees are arrived and those refugees arrived in Jeju Island and are under intense examination of whether they are really lawful refugees and their Korean law or not and of course since they well at least they're claiming that they are fleeing from those conflicts and persecution and we all know that Yemen has currently undergoing this Civil War and we,56.167076s

4, I know that if I call it says they do have some threats in their own country and yeah we have to of course we have to examine the fact that whether they are really facing thus those threats by themselves in their Nation by person by person but it's all they guaranteed or is their right to be examined fairly under those under those posts,86.144899s

12, the difference I guess when you're talking about xenophobia is there already 2 million foreigners leave living illegally in Korea right now the reason people are against it would be more because these people without visas cannot be accounted for but their actions the country itself because it seems such turmoil it cannot take responsibility for these people therefore they're more reluctant to accepting these people,170.034696s
13, the difference I guess when you're talking about xenophobia is there already 2 million foreigners living illegally in Korea right now the reason people are against it would be more because these people without Jesus cannot be accounted for for their actions the country itself because it's in such turmoil it cannot take responsibility for these people therefore the more we looked into it accepting these people,170.044720s
