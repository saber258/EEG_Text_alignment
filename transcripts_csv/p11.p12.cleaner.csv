5, yeah and also the second point is that because of the mass in flux so in 2015 there said there were no in no refugees but the number drastically increased so it also seems like they could potentially be taking advantage of the system or Korean Korean law,75.871657s
6, yeah and also the second point is that because of the mass in flux so in 2015 there said there were no in no refugees but number drastically increased so it also seems like they could potentially be taking advantage of the system or Korean Korean law,75.901724s

10, you know stricken from their rights to be safe and be educated and those kind of stuff and that's why they came to this country and not allowing them to stay in this country even though we actually made into law that we could take them in would be will be,126.405988s

13, you know if he's trying to you know say that you're a nice person but only that be a facade right you're actually a bad person but not lying not for not allowing them to be in here and that was one of the basic human rights issues and the second point would be,149.818959s
14, you know if he trying to you know say that you're a nice person but only that be a facade right you're actually a bad person but not lying not for not allowing them to be in here and that was one of the basic human rights issues and the second point would be,149.828983s
15, Koreans are not letting them because they think they are racist and rapists and terrorists right but those things are not true since they ran away from that were they are the people who don't do not like violence so that's one of the main points that you could say that they don't do it like that,169.603721s
16, fries are not letting them because they think they are racist and rapists and terrorists right but those things are not true since they ran away from that were they are the people who don't do not like violence so that's one of the main points that you could say that they don't do it like that,169.613745s
17, okay so it's all your first point was that you couldn't tell me your first one again so people get it's a basic human rights issue of Koreans made a law that would allow them to come into the country to seek shelter although since they made the system right it they are basically allowing it but once it happens,197.597055s

19, they're not allowing it allowing it so it's basically going against what they originally said they were going to so you're saying we don't want to be like controversial yeah basically what I'm trying to say well I think the ideal is good that deal of letting refugees into our country is good but for the case of the enemy's refugees seeing this mass in flux especially in Korea which is a much,227.725220s

21, other countries with much more linear resources that countries in like Europe or America could possibly be seen as threatening to the Korean people especially because it's only the island of JeJu and judge it was a very small part of Korea with a much more limited population so yeah yeah I guess I guess that's kind of true but you know the other point is that,252.591479s
22, other countries with much more limited resources that countries in like Europe or America could possibly be seen as threatening to the community people especially because it's only the island of JeJu and judge it was a very small part of Korea with a much more limited population so yeah yeah and I guess I guess that's kind of true but you know the other point is that,252.601500s
23, those yemenis are only 500 people right over the course of these years thousand North Korea's came to this country and you know if you think about that North Koreans are currently we're at War stating their these bad people you know according to like the 50s and 60s people they are these bad people with the other Notions and there they could they have the highest possibility of being spies right so in that kind of,282.980232s
24, those yemenis are only 500 people right over the course of these years thousand North Koreans came to this country and you know if you think about that North Koreans are currently we're at War stating their these bad people you know according to like the 50s and 60s people they are these bad people with the other Notions and there they could they have the highest possibility of being spies right so in that kind of,282.990253s
25, view yemenis they're only here to seek shelter they're not here to terrorize or anything like that in cats cats eat for see anything like that but North Koreans coming to this country for seeking shelter could be a bigger issue than that then why are we allowing North Koreans come here but not the yemenis,299.076647s
26, view yemenis they're only here to seek shelter they're not here to terrorize or anything like that it can't cats eat for see anything like that but North Koreans coming to this country for seeking shelter could be a bigger issue than that then why are we allowing North Koreans to come here but not the yemenis,299.096695s
27, well that is a good point on a human rights level the I think they could be viewed in the same way but from a Korean citizens perspective North Korea is still part of current it can still be viewed as an extension of Korea that was just simply divided because the war and especially because it was only a career isn't was only divided like 50 or 60 70 years ago,331.169256s
28, well that is a good point on a human rights level the I think they could be viewed in the same way but from a Korean citizens perspective North Korea is still part of current it can still be viewed as an extension of Korea that was just simply divided because of the war and especially because it was only a career as it was only divided like 50 or 60 70 years ago,331.189303s
29, we share the same language we have a very similar culture but for the yemenis I think it's possible that Korean citizens can do them as Outsiders and I think we should recognize the Korea is a country for Koreans and mutual respect the Korean citizens perspective of like,352.246943s
30, we share the same language we have a very similar culture but for the yemenis I think it's possible that Korean citizens can view them as Outsiders and I think we should recognize the like Korea is a country for Koreans and we should respect the Korean citizens perspective of like,352.327126s
31, like this nationalism,355.895197s

35, these days you know all over the world we're talking about globalism and like we're talking about how other races are living in other countries we already know that being a racist in America is a big issue and like it's just between whites and blacks and those were all occurring issues for the last century right and everyone in the world right now like I guess kind of agrees that being a racist is bad,398.551708s
36, these days you know all over the world we're talking about globalism and like we're talking about how other races are living in other countries we already know that being a racist in America is a big issue and like it's just between whites and blacks and those were all occurring issues for the last century right and everyone in the world right now like I guess kind of agrees that being a racist is bad,398.561728s
37, but isn't that basically what we're trying to were really doing here in Korea being a racist rejecting the other culture without knowing anything about them calling them terrorists rapists and stuff like that I lived in Saudi Arabia for two years and come on that's one of the biggest countries for you know as long as people and over there those people were really nice and I've loved like I didn't get to know their culture or anything like that but if you don't,426.063953s
38, but isn't that basically what we're trying to prove you're really doing here Korea being a racist of rejecting the other culture without knowing anything about them calling them terrorists rapists and stuff like that I lived in Saudi Arabia for two years and come on that's one of the biggest countries for you know as long as people and over there those people were really nice I've loved like I didn't get to know their culture or anything like that but if you don't do anything no weird over there,428.539551s
39, do anything no reared over there and they're really nice and you know you have before before the religion like everyone like I bet everybody like has this kind of compassion these emotion everyone can relate to these emotions and those are the basic you know human stuff I guess and if you get to know those stuff then would have people be more likely to like connect to be seventies and work be more compassionate towards them,455.991664s
40, and they're really nice and you know you have before before the religion like everyone like I bet everybody like has this kind of compassionate Easy Motion everyone can relate to these emotions and those are the basic you know human stuff I guess and if you get to know those stuff then would have people be more likely to like connect to be 70s and or be more compassionate towards them,456.031752s
41, so yeah it's just a book by it's cover I guess,460.291389s
42, so yeah it's like judging a book by it's cover I guess,460.291392s
43, I definitely do agree that that we shouldn't reject the enemies refugees because of this racist image but I think going Beyond racism it's more about national interests so each person in the world is part of a country there are citizens of a country and that that country has its own government and the government is supposed to work in the interest of his people and I don't think it's a bad thing that Korea,491.682410s
44, I definitely do agree that that we shouldn't reject them as refugees because of this racist image but I think going Beyond racism it's more about national interests so each person in the world is part of a country there are citizens of a country and that that country has its own government and the government is supposed to work in the interest of his people and I don't think it's a bad thing that Korea,491.692435s
45, should try to focus more on the citizens I definitely think that we idealistically we should let these people in and from the view of from a human rights movement is that it definitely is good but from the perspective of the Korean citizen in might be a better idea I can definitely understand why people would prefer to spend more tax money on improving more imminent problems with the current Society,521.810574s
46, should try to focus more on the citizens I definitely think that we idealistically we should let these people in and from the view of from Human Rights Viewpoint is that it definitely is good but from the perspective of the Korean citizen in might be a better idea I can definitely understand why people would prefer to spend more tax money on improving more imminent problems with using the Korea Society,521.810576s
47, so more imminent problems you say and you said that like the youth unemployment problem is pretty big and like I agree like youth problems their unemployment they're big but the current issue is I mean these are hearing Jeju Island and if you don't do anything it's just going to escalate from that point right so I guess like some,551.056742s
48, so we're imminent problems you say and you said that like the youth unemployment problem is pretty big and like I agree and like youth problems their unemployment they're big but the current issue is I mean he's our hearing Jeju Island and if you don't do anything it's just going to escalate from that point right so I guess like some,551.116880s
49, speaking of interests of the Jesuit I guess the Jeju Islands was basically developed by the government to become become a tourist like right these yemeni people in these people are coming to use a judge without light without any money without having to pay and they're even getting Financial Financial benefits from the national from Korea that's why I guess you're driving people are against it if you think about the Chinese people,581.936607s
50, like speaking and interests of the Jesuit I guess the Jeju Islands was basically developed by the government to become a become a tourist like right these yemeni people in these people are coming to you such as your ally without any money without anything to pay and they're even getting Financial Financial benefits from the national from Korea that's why I guess you're driving people are against it if you think about the Chinese people,581.936609s
51, to digital and there's like tons of people coming to Jeju Island right but they're spending money there that's why they're not you know they're not against these Chinese people coming in here right so I guess we're just thinking about money too much we could later on like expanded you know if we take care of but these Japanese people,605.088988s
52, to Jeju Island there's like tons of people coming to to Jeju Island right but they're spending money there that's why they're not you know they're not against these Chinese people coming in here right so I guess we're just thinking about money too much we could later on like expanded you know if we take care of these gma's people,607.163684s
