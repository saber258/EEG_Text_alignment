26, I like yourself if there's like you know that countries do it under or I can't imagine what it would be but I recently read that Korea has like their birth rate is getting lower and lower and lower and so like and they there are the number of foreigners,256.530390s
27, living here is also there's a showing of Ingress Ingress right so it's like I think Korea should start accepting that they are should be more exposed to International I mean like other other other people other everyone at this Korean guess like they start,286.488167s
28, leaving here is also a showing of Ingress Ingress right so it's like I think career she'll start accepting that there should be more exposed to International I mean like other other other people other and we go like this Korean Goods like they started,286.508213s
29, interest in Korean and also during which also curious one of the their destination for Refugee and that and also because of this issue actually like the the other parts of the world like the other countries see Korea is like resist or semicolon come here yeah so yeah I mean it's not good for Korea,316.506082s

33, there are already many foreigners that the already leave here in Korea it's still little but it increased little while ago hey and now it with the number of refugees I think they're already a lot of foreigners and Koreans I think it's normal for the people to protect their culture so that they don't mix with another Foreigner culture,356.626854s
34, so you don't want to discriminate,365.687353s
35, for the people to protect their culture so that they don't mix with another Foreigner culture right so you don't want to,376.501820s
36, it is normal for two people to like protect first to protect your culture and then also I think they argue also about the safety of the Korean citizens like there's a killing or right only Korean woman speaking of safety,394.392297s
37, I think they argue also about the safety of the Korean citizens like they're killing or re on the Korean woman speaking of safety it doesn't it doesn't guarantee that if this country only consist of,401.698827s
38, it doesn't it doesn't guarantee that if this country only consists of real all these Koreans it very the safety because as you know there's a there are some cases like women being raped at Night by a little like the case in the how I think I heard the news about the and like people a woman being killed in real number is some some man,424.610665s
