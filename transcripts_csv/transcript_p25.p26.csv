 to approve or to guarantee the status of refugee in the state something like that and also to compare to another country in European country like Germany does have two more very crisis in the refugee problems or issues more than seven hundred thousands but in Korean degree
 to approve or to guarantee the status of refugee in the state something that has and also to compare to another country in Europe and Country like Germany does have more very crisis in the refugee problems or issues more than 700,000 but in Korean agreement is
 veggies is only 550 people solar the first thing that I think the Korean government should accept this group of refugees
 geez is only 550 people so it is the first thing that I think the Korean government should accept this group of refugees
 okay yeah that I agree with you with that okay Korean does sign convention in 1991 but
 okay yeah that I agree with you with that okay Korean just side of convention in 1991 but
 I just think that it's like a special case for the Koreans who have like their their body instigate like with the XO phobia sometimes and they're just like care about the conditioned living so I think if you think about your population first and there are some so very that have already so way that they are more proposed proportion of Korean population so I just
 I just think that it's like a special case for the Koreans who have like their their bodies the is like with the XO phobia sometimes and they're just like care about the conditioned living so I think if you think about your population first and there are some so very that have or these away that there are more populous proportion of Korean population so I just
 thing that if you just do four
 I think that if you just do four
 follow the convention is not the best way to be the good just for the country but you have to look and take care of your relation also so it's just like
 follow the convention is not the best way to be the good just for the country but you have to look and take care your place and also it was like
 if you
 if you
 listen your people first
 listen your people first
 it will be good so I think it's not good if we accept all yemenis gratuities at Jeju Island yeah
 it will be good so I think is not do it if we accept all yemenis refugees at they dryer yea but I think in do appropriate of the other refugees in Korean bioderma Co tested actually it's just 2.4% from 1994 the sin that is the first time that Korea and South Korea and
 but I think do appropriate of the refugees in Korean butter with your vested actually is just 2.4% from 1994 the sin that the first time that Korea and South Korean government except the a refugee and but
 except the a refugee and but actually it's fun up to none up until now the government also consider voice of the South Korean citizens and by that by the consider that they requirement already put their dmn citizen remains traveler a citizen that want to come in to Curry
 actually it's fun up to none up until now the government also consider walls of the South Korean citizens and by that by the consider that they are requirement already put their game in citizen I already miss traveler or citizen that want to come into Korean have to get some result before but so I think this
 Ian have to get some result before but so I think this this is a liar easiest way for now to deal with this problem and about the signal for beer that you rest I think this studying that if Korean want to be in the Lea Archery internationalized Country or developed country we have or the government have
 this is a slider easiest way for now to deal with this problem and about the signal for beer that you rest I think this stating that if Korean want to be in the Lea Archery internationalized Country or developed country we have or the government's have to educate the currency teaching people how to living in a globalization work
 the characters currency to seven people how to living in a globalization work
 okay so
 okay so
 I just put at this right Arisa topics now first it's like you say Korean government has put the human to the result list but it's like if you have like another countries or like Outsider just do like this again so it's just like
 I just put the SS right away sir topics now first it's like you say Korean government has put the human to the result list but it's like if you have like another country's or like a cider just do like this again so it's just like
 but the road is Commander being a refugee yeah it's like if some countries is like want to be refugees and comes and do like the yemenis as I think that if they just put the country in the list is not the best way this is the easiest way that yes but it's not the best one it's like
 Commander being a refugee yeah it's like if some countries just like want to be their equities and comes and do like the yemenis as I think that if they just put the country in the list is not the best way it was the easiest way that yes but it's not the best one it's like
 if the there are a lot so the bezel is like too long and it's not good for the image also yeah and to like
 if the there are a lot so the bezel it is like too long and it's not good for the image also yeah and to like
 we don't know like if we accept refugee
 we don't know like if we accept the refugee
 nothing can guarantee about Korean citizens live security and I think also it's like the Privacy also so I think so
 nothing can guarantee about Korean citizens life security and I think also is like the Privacy also so I think so yeah I also accept that for this comment about a researcher is and also the some highlighter for receive other citizenship of South Korea and but I think
 I also accept that for just comment about the wizard is and also the some highlighter for receive other citizenship of South Koreans and but I think for the South Korean so policy of accepting refugees is also already rigorous for that because of the place of acceptance is just only 2%
 Florida to South Korea to policy of accepting a refugee is on is also already rigorous for that because of the rest of accepting it just only 2%
 from there over ten thousand Thirty thousands of people to apply for energy but cannot expect but get the rejection from that and by racing there are there are some requests of petition from the citizens of to the Blue House of Korean and I think the government now considering that to give more deliberate
 from there over 10,000 30 thousands of people to apply for really see but cannot expect but get the rejection from that and by raising the rear there are some requests or petition from the citizens of to the Blue House of Korean and I think the government now considering that to give more deliberate
 process or for get for giving their refugees get up to the other nations nationality and also they this is some car like they call hit or humanitarians few minutes rent with us that the government only give this result to Refugee only one years to guarantee that when their circumstances
 assess or for get for giving their refugees data to the other nations nationality and also they this is some car like they call hit or humanitarians humanitarian visas that the government only give this result to the refugee or 31 years to guarantee that when their circumstances
 so situation they're in their their home country is becoming Wheels good get better and they can guarantee that they will leave career

 so situation the in their their home country is becoming Wheels good get better and they can guarantee that they will lead career right that I think like it's just like 2% that Korean government us proof about the Visa order represent us but we just still have don't know or just not being currently like
 right that I think like it's just like 2% that Korean government has proved about a Visa or the refugee status but we just still have don't know nothing currently like it's not clear about a refugee State at all so it's like if they do the wrong things what legals illegals or how the government do how the police do
 it's not clear about your Equity say that also is like if they do the wrong things what legals illegals or how the government do how the police do for the refugees something like that so I think is about a life conditions of the Korea is also like they just want to know how should they do and how should they can practice your daily with Lexa T is like it's not it's not
 order refugees something like that so I think is about alive conditions of the Korea is also like they just want to know how should they do and how should they can how should they leave with less booty is like it's not it's not it's still not clear for now so it's like
 if they're not clear for an hour so it's like
 I think they just want to know about the things that can guarantee their life that's just what I want to say so if it's for my opinion are go men can explain in this question and I think like all Korean movie rest the question I think it will be
 I think they just want to know about the things that can guarantee their life this is what I want to say so if it's for my opinion are go men can explain in this question and I think like all Korean maybe raise the question I think it will be
 good things it's like now it's not but in the future is maybe can yeah
 good things it's like now it's not but in the future is maybe can yeah
 you mean that how to guarantee the yeah is like is the big question for our Korean actually the refugee
 under the laws of the Korean yeah I think if they do something wrong or cause sometimes so they could give penalty or punishment from the law as well
 you mean that how to garden theater yeah the big question or Korean actually rigidity under the laws of the Korean yeah I think if they do something wrong or cause some clams so they will give penalty or punishment from the law as well
 so in this case I think is
 so in this case I think is
 not only for leadership for everyone that you grabbed and empty and you made I think that restoration because the some Koreans have Instinct awesome fear with agricultural or xenophobia that you have received that yet I think there's some kind of more emotional than rational questions they are have some fear of you insecure that they are happier that
 not only for a little edgy for everyone that you have and I'm too and you mean I think that race question because the some Koreans have Instinct often fear with other cultural or xenophobia that you have received that yeah I think there's some kind of more emotional than rational equations yeah because they are have some fear of you insecure that they are happier that
 never seen something like that paid more than others some problem that's called inside they're feeling knots from there that their Fiji yeah and put on that patients I think you may be at a Korean citizenship maybe you have to trust your government process there that will debut accept only that good quality refugee
 never seen something like that Faith before something like that I think it's a problem that's called inside they're feeling not from their better to G yeah and put on that patients I think you may be at a Korean citizenship maybe you have to trust your process yeah that Booth day will you accept only that good quality refugees
 he that we may cause no clams in the future
 see that view may cause no clams yeah in the future
 it's over now
