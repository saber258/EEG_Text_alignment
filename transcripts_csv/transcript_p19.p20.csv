 I understand your idea but I think the case of USA is a case of 30 of like almost a century ago and it should be up to occur it shouldn't be applicable to now because as you can see if you refer to other examples in countries like European countries like Germany French Greece or turkey they actually face a lot of problems regarding their Refugee because
 I understand your idea but I think the case of USA is a case of 30 of like almost a century ago and it should be up like it shouldn't be applicable to now because as you can see if you refer to other examples in countries like European country that Germany French Greece or turkey they actually face a lot of problems regarding their Refugee because
 I think Germany and France and Greece have problems but how about turkey turkey is not actually they only put the refugee inside the camp they don't let the few Fuji outside of the camp I didn't even know what the news that turkey has receiving the refugees
 I think Germany and France and Greece have problems but how about turkey turkey is not actually they only put the refugee inside the camp they don't let the p53 outside the camp I didn't even know what the news that turkey has receiving the refugees
 except for Syria except for Syria they actually put the if you read the news they actually put a refugee in the candidate they actually warned that they got to release the refugee from the can as a warning sign for like a kind of risk or a threat to the u.s. to the European Union so I believe that they actually have to Refugee and they just use a lot of refugee at one of the threat but I think that's not my main argument
 except for syrians except for Syria they actually put the if you read the news they actually put a refugee in the camp and they actually warned that they got to doing these the refugee from the camp as a warning sign for like a kind of risk or a threat to the u.s. to the European Union so I believe that they actually have to Refugee and they just use a lot of refugee at one of the threat but I think that's not my main argument
 might be an argument here is that by putting you at the strongest is why not be applicable to the current situation right now and if we look at Korea Korea is actually not voluntary accepting the refugee at comparing to you as us actually they welcome the refugee as one of the way for their country to develop but career has already developed and this infrastructure in these political system is not suitable
 my been argument here is that by putting us at the strongest is why not be applicable to the current situation right now and if we look at Korea Korea is actually not voluntary accepting the refugee at comparing to u.s. u.s. actually they welcome the refugee as one of the wave of their country to develop but career has already developed and this infrastructure and Miss political system is not suitable
 ooh for receiving the profusion I don't think so
 oil for receiving the diffusion I can I don't think so
 I don't think so Korea needs to be better off Korea s economy The Divided one is stopped and if it may be the refugees from resettling refugees have a good idea about Korea that should be the way to new breakthrough to the way of Korea to say oh they're Market to that means Yemen or Syria or something
 I didn't think so for real deep to be divided of Korea's economic development is top and if it may be the refugees from resettling refugees have a good idea about Korea that should be the way to new breakthrough to the way of Korea to say oh they're Market to that means Yemen or Syria or or something some repetition
 priest should be the new market of Korea it is an investment for the future
 countries should be the new market of Korea it is an investment for the future
 and not enough for the Faria the other countries grew up and Syria Europe and turkey
 and now it now pour the Korea the other countries Iraq and Syria Europe and turkey
 I can party should be banned for this argument turkey is not a it can be concluded for this problem we should we should make a camp inside of Jeju Island to Porter refugees not a city not a copper images we should make a camp it is Jeju Island is not a can is nature people and refugees the harmony call refugees
 I can turkey should be banned for this argument turkey is not it can be seen grilled it for this problem we should we should make a can inside of Jeju Island to poor refugees not ready now the topper images we should make a camp it is Jeju Island is not a can its nature people and repudiate the harmony call refugees

 but regarding the development of Korea I think that is it better to focus on Korean people first when you develop Korea because Korean people is actually the poor resources of Korea like Korea hasn't is used to be from watching this country so even with Korean people do they actually you guys actually was able to develop into one of the main power in the world so isn't keep focusing on Korean people is one of the way to develop
 but regarding the development of Korea I think that is it better to focus on Korean people first when you develop Korea because Korean people that read the core resources of Korea like Korea hasn't is used to be a homogeneous country so even with Korean people do they actually you guys actually was able to develop into one of the main power in the world so isn't keep focusing on Korean people is one of the way to develop to develop Korea
 to develop Korea into a better country in the future and talking about Korean people actually the year the Yemen Refugee in in Jeju Island actually cause a lot of trouble for Korean people like the people who residing in Korea and they actually stick to seven cases of Korean woman who actually adopted by Korean by the gemenese refugee so isn't it isn't it isn't it the focus of Korean people
 a better country in the future and talking about Korean people actually do you the Yemen if Yugi in in Jeju Island actually cause a lot of trouble for Korean people like the people who residing in Korea and they actually stick to seven cases of Korean woman who actually got adopted by Korean I buy the gemenese refugee so isn't it isn't it isn't it the focus of Korean people to protect is
 to protect is is countrymen first instead of receiving those people from oversea and and in order for example if you want to get them in I want to get the refugee and just in case that you need to have a real treatment a huge amount of resources to actually build camp or actually have a proper way for the Yemen people to actually mingle with the Korean people because Korean is actually as I said before a homogeneous country
 is countrymen first instead of receiving those people from oversea and and in order for example if you want to get them in I want to get the refugee and just in case that you need to have a real treatment like a huge amount of resources to actually build cam or actually have a proper way for the Yemen people to actually mingle with the Korean people because Korean is actually as I said people are homogeneous country so they don't really accept
 They Don't Really accept a lot of international people from oversea so in my that case I think Korean people need to change a lot and need to invest a lot not just in not such like in resources but also in their mindset in order to accept the refugee and at them to become Korean North Korea is not not not everybody responds to any more Korea side has receiving refugees
 International people from over C so in that case I think Korean people need to change a lot and need to invest a lot not just in not such like in resources but also in their mindset in order to accept the refugee and help them to become Korean North Korea is not luck now the homogeneous flow Theory anymore Priyanka I have had receiving refugees from
 especially girls from the rural side including Android side career says always has lack of Boomers
 So Korea s rural side has decreasing continuously decreasing people so we should we should get refugees for the photo Korean rural sites of decrease of decreasing to people
 from especially towards from the Riverside included words I could have no such as always as lack of women's So Korea s rural site has decreasing contrary see decreasing people so we should we should get refugees for the whole of Korean rural sites of decree of the Cuisines you people

 Korea so and because of the differences that actually caused some kind of fear and some kind of a kind of resistance from the Korean people to accept the Yemen which in a way make the game and difficult to settle here and make the
