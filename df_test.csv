do agree that that we shouldn't reject them as refugees because of,-1.202,-0.979,-1.278,-1.268,-0.207,-0.216,0.049,-1.007,-1.09,-1.28,-1.316,-1.262,0.694,-0.255,-2.675,-1.695,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,1,1
is their priority they have some priority for that,-1.612,-1.461,-1.528,-1.346,-0.22,-0.779,-2.215,-1.897,-1.267,-1.066,-1.206,-1.268,-0.475,-0.65,-1.391,-1.567,3,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
as you said it could be a better decision,-1.667,-1.343,-1.568,-1.333,-0.9,-1.034,-1.553,-1.702,-1.395,-1.115,-0.948,-1.261,-0.333,-0.594,-1.973,-1.819,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,1,2,1
so their country their cultures are different they're such thinking is different,-1.361,-1.392,-1.392,-1.36,-0.7,-0.987,0.547,-1.454,-0.29,-0.86,-0.774,-1.095,4.306,2.853,0.393,0.298,3,4,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
okay Point she said that they are abusing the law but the question of the debate is whether Korea should,-1.078,-0.97,-1.382,-1.237,0.403,0.1,-0.143,-1.233,-1.398,-1.472,-1.383,-1.279,-0.534,-0.902,-0.913,-1.404,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
because they thought the country was dangerous after all and,-0.859,-0.787,-1.45,-1.195,2.35,-0.089,-1.576,-1.505,-1.578,-1.533,-1.521,-1.393,-0.568,-0.64,-2.198,-1.668,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,1,2,1
currently undergoing this Civil War and we I know that if I call,-0.662,-0.715,-0.394,0.645,-0.168,0.165,0.596,0.201,-1.17,-1.354,-1.167,-0.99,1.033,7.198,-1.596,-0.873,3,2,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
like has this kind of compassionate Easy Motion everyone can relate to these emotions,-1.407,-1.486,-1.557,-1.397,-1.016,-1.11,-2.36,-1.855,-1.079,-1.051,-1.147,-1.166,0.07,0.021,-1.599,-1.538,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,1,1
wow,-1.014,-0.758,-1.279,-1.137,1.075,1.279,0.377,-1.135,-1.444,-1.236,-1.264,-1.181,-0.309,-0.706,-2.254,-1.777,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
a group that there were an activist are trying to defend their own country and then they ended up,-1.479,-1.283,-1.425,-1.34,0.543,-0.242,-0.036,-1.692,-1.418,-1.194,-1.3,-1.357,0.41,-0.082,-0.487,-1.601,4,3,2,2,2,1,3,3,2,2,2,1
French Greece or turkey they actually face a lot of problems regarding their Refugee,-0.88,-1.029,-1.142,-0.834,-0.168,-0.042,-1.351,-1.32,-0.419,-0.613,-0.046,-0.589,2.51,4.964,-0.178,-1.055,4,2,1,1,3,1,2,3,1,1,2,1
country so she'll provide the solution like they,-1.559,-1.497,-1.468,-1.384,0.063,0.013,-2.05,-1.713,-1.016,-1.238,-1.195,-0.542,2.692,1.198,0.785,-1.006,3,3,3,1,2,1,3,4,3,1,1,2
that those yemenis are only 500 people right over the course of,-0.862,-0.844,-1.381,-1.336,-0.226,0.399,-1.126,-0.895,-1.486,-1.523,-1.495,-1.383,-1.072,-0.984,-2.158,-1.912,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
for Mike those I'll start with my point of view first,-1.565,-1.21,-1.437,-1.371,-0.532,-0.599,-1.702,-1.344,-1.543,-1.353,-1.537,-1.41,-0.765,-1.168,-1.293,-1.628,3,2,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
so well yeah I do,0.465,-0.095,-0.724,-0.739,-0.371,-0.774,1.263,-0.504,-1.453,-1.345,-1.461,-1.338,-0.753,-0.825,-0.718,-1.808,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
of a cultural Melting Pot like other First World countries yeah I think that's,2.532,2.344,2.069,0.637,13.928,9.961,0.162,-0.779,-1.375,-1.521,-1.409,-1.337,0.243,-0.095,-0.989,-1.515,3,3,2,2,1,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
under those posts asses and loss stand loss,-0.663,0.315,-0.774,-1.19,-0.667,-0.482,-1.176,-0.198,-1.034,-1.098,-0.86,-1.088,0.637,0.942,-0.724,-0.957,2,3,1,1,2,1,4,3,1,1,2,1
you know the thing is that when you just,-1.133,-1.258,-1.293,-1.319,-0.402,-0.854,-1.641,-1.636,-0.655,-0.948,-1.378,-1.212,0.235,-0.374,-0.382,-0.736,2,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,3,1
Society about refugees yeah I mean because because government,-0.79,-0.033,-0.687,-0.902,-0.844,-0.707,0.409,-0.062,-0.96,0.26,-0.49,0.257,2.365,2.835,1.235,-0.209,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
would be but I recently read that Korea has,-1.108,-0.833,-1.3,-1.284,1.592,0.081,-0.393,-1.623,-1.674,-1.414,-1.538,-1.415,-0.794,-1.143,-2.566,-1.411,3,3,3,2,2,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
currently in Jeju largely because a lot of the population is not,0.659,-0.938,-0.014,0.728,-0.173,-0.159,2.437,-0.661,-1.59,-1.489,-1.573,-1.317,-0.965,-1.125,-2.651,-1.809,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
I mean joke our country defined in the constitution,-1.344,-1.453,-1.46,-1.149,-0.811,-0.928,-0.406,-1.427,-1.646,-1.43,-1.446,-1.371,-0.818,-1.021,-2.958,-2.064,4,4,2,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
now you may begin okay so I think I will start with,-1.495,-1.384,-1.479,-1.376,-0.829,-0.991,-1.173,-1.342,-0.959,-0.825,-1.158,-1.21,0.076,-0.035,0.438,-0.177,2,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,2,1
instead of actually protesting against immigration they should actually be protesting,-1.637,-1.555,-1.543,-1.331,-0.849,-1.109,-2.041,-1.757,-0.888,-0.812,-1.027,-0.836,2.117,0.901,-0.01,-0.966,2,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
more deliberate assess or for get for giving their,-1.623,-1.53,-1.489,-1.238,-0.8,-0.79,-1.784,-1.837,-1.022,-0.792,-1.089,-1.127,0.533,0.187,-1.124,-1.587,3,4,1,1,2,1,4,4,2,1,1,1
two different and also although there is no like confirmation,-1.16,-1.232,-1.4,-1.195,0.745,0.66,0.533,-1.265,-1.023,-1.026,-1.155,-1.059,-0.115,-0.369,-0.887,-1.329,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
but if we double for Jeju Island I think and secondly for the humanist book you mentioned,-1.297,-1.481,-1.152,-1.354,1.119,0.117,-1.873,-1.663,-0.294,0.461,0.061,-0.304,5.992,3.087,0.192,-0.911,2,3,2,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
help to help to supply labor for that,-1.434,-1.309,-1.443,-1.156,-0.492,-0.696,-1.812,-1.322,-1.523,-1.482,-1.421,-1.294,-1.125,-1.008,-0.91,-1.891,4,3,1,1,3,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
Beaker respect the respect you have to suggest,-1.146,-0.368,-1.238,-1.029,-0.027,0.306,-0.454,-0.315,-1.586,-1.447,-1.457,-1.254,-0.562,-0.746,-1.53,-1.684,3,4,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,1,1
and see like they have a,-1.658,-1.47,-1.57,-1.371,-1.03,-1.283,-2.767,-2.009,-1.09,-0.957,-1.346,-1.075,0.415,-0.264,-0.425,0.473,2,2,1,1,2,1,3,4,1,1,3,1
like Germany Peach Germany actually assess accepted a lot of refugees,-1.607,-1.617,-1.524,-1.426,-0.411,-1.007,-2.93,-2.053,-1.366,-1.257,-1.518,-1.302,-0.604,-0.669,-0.234,-1.758,3,3,1,2,1,2,3,3,1,2,1,1
the first time that Korea and South Korean government except the a refugee and,-1.509,-1.288,-1.418,-1.279,0.366,-0.357,-1.415,-1.565,-1.521,-0.914,-1.394,-1.367,0.364,-0.204,-1.462,-1.094,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
enough wealth to support and then the current young,-1.031,-0.82,-1.15,-0.994,1.737,0.157,0.881,-1.247,-1.443,-1.506,-1.35,-1.365,-0.227,-0.803,-2.454,-1.932,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,4,1,1,1,1
is somewhere near 1 million people in people will get gems around for,-1.512,-1.281,-1.333,-1.227,0.832,-0.03,-1.52,-1.659,-1.438,-1.519,-1.4,-1.262,-0.264,-0.619,-1.794,-1.941,3,4,2,2,2,1,3,2,2,1,1,1
not really that Tidwell you know sort of like living together with people,-1.574,-1.532,-1.524,-1.415,-0.661,-1.127,-2.97,-2.018,-0.875,-1.073,-1.336,-1.073,-0.422,-0.798,-0.384,-1.091,3,3,2,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,2
if you refer to other examples in countries like European countries like Germany,-1.421,-0.648,-0.968,-1.34,1.614,0.399,-0.716,-1.084,5.526,2.313,0.35,1.581,4.729,6.361,-0.391,-0.084,4,2,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,2,1
state that issues in second reason,-1.409,-1.432,-1.315,-1.386,-0.487,-0.923,-1.519,-1.736,-1.091,-1.32,-1.109,-0.94,1.786,-0.124,-2.303,-1.778,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,1,1
sure it's a good idea is if he just if,-1.519,-1.277,-1.359,-1.291,0.473,1.177,-0.719,-1.149,-1.58,-0.926,-1.429,-1.27,-0.734,-0.979,-0.088,-1.869,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
on this seminar we have a lot of seminar mainly,-1.502,-1.357,-1.498,-1.354,-0.389,-0.953,-2.013,-1.819,-1.655,-1.622,-1.506,-1.424,-0.54,-1.113,-3.034,-2.026,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
terrorists right but those things are not TRUE since,-1.694,-1.58,-1.617,-1.437,-1.15,-1.163,-2.758,-1.996,-1.405,-1.077,-1.351,-1.297,0.364,-0.286,-1.354,-1.747,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,2,1,1,3,1
and by racing there are there are some requests of petition from the,-1.379,-1.012,-1.325,-1.153,-0.323,-0.504,-0.422,-1.174,-1.213,-1.155,-1.088,-1.157,1.053,0.012,-1.03,-1.126,3,4,1,1,2,1,4,4,2,1,1,1
all,1.121,1.596,-0.235,0.439,1.999,1.005,0.963,1.798,-1.435,-1.015,-1.403,-1.097,0.246,-0.469,-0.064,-0.815,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
yeah that's my favorite,-0.555,0.737,0.317,-0.959,6.113,10.611,0.217,-1.232,-1.502,-1.433,-1.414,-1.342,-0.325,-0.19,-0.509,-1.328,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
the future immigration but would you agree that at least Korea is more developed,-1.473,-1.103,-1.479,-1.291,0.044,-0.453,-1.37,-1.094,-1.38,-1.384,-1.306,-1.277,-0.625,-0.882,-2.101,-1.331,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
right now is irrelevant from this debate because that's what we are deciding right now whether we should change the laws so that,-1.634,-1.5,-1.54,-1.43,-0.811,-0.91,-2.559,-1.904,-1.341,-1.131,-1.406,-1.133,-0.318,-0.432,-0.291,-1.413,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,4,1,1,1,1
tell which one is the fake Refugee and in early 2015,-1.276,-1.008,-1.071,-1.01,0.84,0.136,-0.825,-1.175,-1.498,-1.435,-1.302,-1.386,-0.529,-0.979,-2.979,-2.06,2,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,2,1,3,1
that they make it is TRUE that it can be a corruption but I think it would be a dream for yourself,-1.294,-1.024,-1.218,-1.188,0.288,-0.184,-0.518,-1.29,-1.577,-1.402,-0.734,-1.322,-0.337,-0.401,-3.046,-2.003,2,3,2,1,1,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
even if it doesn't guarantee that this the,-1.306,-1.505,-1.264,-1.229,0.835,0.719,-1.536,-1.836,-0.542,-0.59,-1.054,-1.048,0.801,-0.038,-0.764,-1.503,3,3,2,2,2,2,3,3,2,1,2,2
are if there is already a substantial amount of foreign foreign people and especially people,-0.773,-1.08,-1.153,-0.894,-0.09,0.312,0.298,-1.094,-1.409,-1.491,-1.331,-1.292,0.022,-0.39,-1.437,-1.604,4,3,1,2,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
has much more capable of accepting refugees than four examples some Nations who have already,-1.124,-0.352,-1.135,-0.989,1.318,0.214,0.895,-0.609,-1.157,-0.694,-0.944,-1.136,1.686,1.991,0.838,-0.616,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,1,2,1
that and sort of get over the you know hatred and fear to just you know kick,-1.558,-1.481,-1.537,-1.357,-0.782,-1.015,-2.801,-1.899,-1.394,-1.3,-1.444,-1.309,-0.601,-0.826,-1.224,-1.793,3,3,1,2,1,1,3,3,1,2,1,1
I think they argue also about the safety,-1.198,-1.033,-1.495,-1.062,1.54,0.228,-1.217,-1.167,-1.481,-1.382,-1.263,-1.255,1.039,0.087,-2.303,-1.814,3,3,2,2,2,1,3,3,2,1,1,2
Nations and it's also one of the countries who which signed,-0.578,-0.669,-1.286,-0.691,0.399,-0.249,-0.005,-0.737,-1.225,-1.228,-1.276,-0.979,-0.547,-0.805,0.231,-0.848,3,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,2,1
it be what it called you know if he trying,-1.324,-1.278,-1.459,-1.194,-0.699,-0.946,-0.914,-1.772,-1.153,-1.236,-1.07,-1.201,-0.075,0.079,-1.318,-1.548,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
care of Koreans in a way because what if those what if Koreans don't want those jobs,-1.542,-1.363,-1.489,-1.349,-0.635,-0.46,-1.464,-1.735,-0.701,-0.841,-0.491,-1.034,1.716,2.244,0.37,-0.373,2,3,2,1,1,1,4,4,3,1,2,1
to so it's an on enforcing act therefore there's no,-1.373,-1.537,-1.504,-1.314,-0.31,-0.747,-2.63,-1.776,-1.27,-0.778,-1.232,-1.196,0.686,0.487,0.191,-1.185,3,3,2,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
I think that even even refugees can like help,-1.569,-1.436,-1.498,-1.363,-0.446,-0.93,-1.871,-1.535,-1.45,-1.425,-1.384,-1.24,-0.682,-0.684,-0.382,-1.636,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1

people of Korea mostly use fear and intuition in judging the issue and government,-1.506,-1.339,-1.28,-1.016,-0.621,-0.811,0.189,-1.296,-1.312,-1.35,-1.364,-1.172,-0.564,-0.79,-0.78,-1.687,4,3,1,1,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,1

a graph solutions to accept more people so I think maybe slowly accepting,-1.538,-1.571,-1.523,-1.412,-0.412,-0.803,-3.004,-2.082,-1.421,-1.372,-1.541,-1.348,-0.083,-0.748,0.63,-1.811,2,3,1,2,1,1,3,3,1,2,1,1
in resources but also in their mindset in order to,-1.185,-1.247,-1.299,-1.1,1.362,0.289,-1.458,-1.039,-0.738,-0.062,-0.586,-0.845,2.926,1.623,-1.155,-0.76,3,2,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,2,2,1

like money that was already reserved for citizens to,-0.61,-0.506,-1.073,-0.932,1.844,1.457,-0.473,0.002,-1.513,-1.29,-1.547,-1.359,-0.449,-0.873,-1.059,-1.487,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
and more International laws and there's a reason why I said they would exhibitions,-1.478,-1.499,-1.517,-1.378,-0.636,-0.625,-1.87,-1.913,-1.607,-1.493,-1.487,-1.411,-0.58,-1.023,-2.624,-1.834,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1

of all I think what's important is corrupting them on on wrong information factually wrong,-1.357,-1.293,-1.331,-1.168,0.36,0.128,-0.015,-0.658,-1.558,-1.329,-1.492,-1.169,-0.401,-0.595,-1.608,-0.725,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1

like a small number of 500 people and also Korea is a very young nation and,-1.362,-1.322,-1.273,-1.204,0.343,-0.256,0.618,-1.653,-1.354,-1.184,-1.512,-1.208,-0.31,-0.882,-0.991,-0.975,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1

cause of the so I don't think like,-1.218,-1.108,-1.306,-1.079,-0.631,-1.041,-0.316,-1.586,-1.07,-1.303,-1.38,-1.264,-0.468,-0.416,-0.91,-1.658,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,2,1,1,1

for Koreans to suddenly say all this not accepting refugees just because we are all One National,-1.384,-1.501,-1.518,-1.259,-0.899,-0.946,-2.045,-1.748,-1.594,-1.491,-1.567,-1.369,-0.783,-1.151,-1.215,-1.738,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
to take them say the last part which is mostly the first construed,-1.322,-0.995,-1.464,-1.136,0.616,-0.801,0.911,-1.162,-1.359,-1.27,-1.443,-1.196,-0.274,-0.742,-1.97,-1.764,3,4,1,2,1,2,3,3,2,1,1,1

have mentioned that if these people lives in nearby,-1.374,-1.516,-1.55,-1.364,-0.44,-0.886,-1.675,-1.868,-1.292,-1.413,-0.429,-1.236,-0.304,-0.845,-2.499,-1.881,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
larger in Korea because the culture itself is,-1.503,-1.058,-0.938,-0.918,0.869,1.767,-0.459,-0.984,-1.186,-1.125,-1.353,-1.279,0.161,0.566,-0.041,-1.432,3,3,1,1,2,1,4,3,1,1,2,1
so I think the refugees don't have a choice,-1.601,-1.377,-1.34,-1.398,0.053,-0.367,-1.166,-1.284,-1.046,-1.128,-0.636,-0.986,0.113,-0.114,-0.754,-1.212,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
reaction due to the xenophobia or they don't like,-1.445,-1.125,-1.458,-1.31,-0.423,-0.712,-1.271,-1.206,-1.077,-0.942,-1.196,-1.066,-0.12,-0.439,-1.188,-0.804,2,2,2,2,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
that basically what we're trying to were really doing here in Korea being a racist rejecting,-1.571,-1.505,-1.561,-1.349,-0.767,-1.159,-2.356,-1.943,-1.08,-1.314,-1.088,-1.145,0.959,0.609,-1.608,-1.271,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,2,1,1,2,1
gates in the law and the second you said that Koreans and Muslims are so different that it's it's not realistic that they live together,-1.086,-1.103,-1.501,-1.397,-0.018,-0.323,-0.459,-1.734,-1.212,-0.638,-0.99,-1.125,-0.406,-0.572,-0.262,-1.287,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,2,1
dumb by Muslims and Europe,-1.508,-1.253,-1.378,-1.279,-0.152,-0.499,-2.185,-1.767,-0.315,0.316,0.365,-0.304,6.058,4.028,-0.019,-1.398,2,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
so we can think of all the examples such as States bringing people from South America,-1.484,-1.349,-1.368,-1.195,1.468,0.222,-0.25,-1.019,-1.489,-1.269,-1.149,-0.919,0.592,0.075,-1.869,-1.519,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
s okay so well you,-0.66,-0.483,-0.585,0.604,-0.02,0.687,-1.483,0.851,-0.503,-0.892,-0.705,-0.969,0.728,-0.214,-0.096,-0.938,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
well I mean where do you think the remedy should be taken if it's not pretty cool yeah you,-1.178,-1.162,-1.459,-1.339,0.168,0.079,-0.463,-1.24,-1.463,-1.275,-1.358,-1.163,0.799,0.004,-2.635,-1.918,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,2
as you know that we were put into the industrial revolution,-1.052,-0.993,-0.869,-1.13,1.943,1.697,-0.292,-0.987,-1.68,-1.654,-1.613,-1.434,-1.054,-1.257,-2.804,-2.022,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,2
can you I don't understand the meaning of religious,-0.917,-0.807,-1.191,-1.109,0.788,0.042,-0.24,-1.39,-1.354,-1.241,-1.107,-1.185,1.867,1.077,-1.687,-1.177,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,2,1,1,1
the definition of refugees or,-1.39,-1.534,-1.499,-1.392,-0.853,-1.036,-2.51,-1.919,-1.505,-1.517,-1.305,-1.337,0.116,0.287,-0.783,-1.84,3,4,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,2,1
now they're dying that to and the reality European Refugee crisis which,-1.144,-0.924,-1.214,-1.095,1.58,0.621,-1.902,-1.244,-1.189,-1.243,-1.142,-0.879,0.442,-0.161,-1.603,-1.757,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,2,1,1,1
this racist image but I think going Beyond racism it's more about national,-1.383,-1.38,-1.4,-1.174,-0.127,-0.568,-0.319,-1.366,-1.002,-1.342,-1.295,-1.232,0.028,-0.871,-0.951,-1.854,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,1,1
as you know is hard to come to Korea because,-1.705,-1.639,-1.594,-1.454,-1.088,-1.257,-2.956,-2.033,-1.333,-0.909,-1.081,-1.193,-0.209,-0.663,-0.172,-1.532,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,1,2,1
mentioned that refugees the definition of refugees,-1.425,-1.565,-1.427,-1.273,-0.78,-0.951,-0.57,-1.901,-1.398,-1.101,-1.384,-1.271,-0.262,-0.517,-1.548,-1.688,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,2,1,2,1
I would like to say something against what she have just argued primarily,-1.468,-1.411,-1.54,-1.322,-0.555,-0.731,-1.684,-1.61,-1.042,-1.149,-0.951,-1.249,0.615,1.551,-0.387,-1.185,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
mostly like talking about Jeju Island all the foreigners right so we're,-1.46,-1.294,-1.5,-1.375,-0.153,-0.699,-2.444,-1.644,-1.543,-1.279,-1.531,-1.343,-0.614,-0.874,-2.061,-1.935,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
like their birth rate is getting lower and lower and lower and,-1.306,-0.808,-1.326,-1.239,0.493,0.589,-0.85,-1.204,-1.613,-1.505,-1.579,-1.395,-0.96,-1.095,-0.854,-1.375,3,3,3,2,2,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
from your men right and they left because the their country at the Terrors and regime was being,-1.443,-1.362,-1.501,-1.291,-0.409,-0.395,-0.778,-1.734,-1.59,-1.125,-1.421,-1.225,-0.596,-0.767,-2.003,-1.65,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
that,-1.49,-1.342,-1.312,-1.315,-0.689,-1.012,-1.978,-1.716,-1.084,-1.552,-1.405,-1.214,0.484,0.141,-1.693,-1.472,3,4,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
to the culture and like the food in general is different from Korea so,-1.548,-1.349,-1.464,-1.283,-0.385,-0.902,-1.768,-1.311,-1.348,-1.454,-1.334,-1.276,-0.181,-0.532,-2.385,-1.972,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,4,1,1,1,1
can was able to run away from their own country and,-0.705,-0.368,-1.264,-1.219,0.535,-0.16,-1.053,-0.816,-1.409,-1.494,-1.19,-1.287,-0.39,-0.704,-2.137,-1.655,3,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
closed by the Islam's fighting over but then Korea is not an Islamic country so,-1.653,-1.479,-1.546,-1.344,-0.907,-1.186,-2.401,-1.967,-1.501,-1.154,-1.359,-1.29,-0.116,-0.3,-2.288,-1.191,4,4,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
Korea as a homogeneous society should actually become a little bit more heterogeneous and more,-1.494,-1.514,-1.593,-1.423,-1.02,-1.16,-2.798,-2.005,-1.435,-1.092,-1.392,-1.218,0.375,0.703,0.259,-1.392,2,3,2,2,1,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
Korean population so I just thing that if you just,-1.219,-1.466,-1.3,-1.106,1.536,1.413,-1.367,-1.21,-1.485,-0.752,-1.524,-1.266,1.456,0.412,-1.169,-0.925,4,3,1,1,1,1,3,4,2,1,1,1
is two countries that have were and Refugee problem,-0.757,-0.943,-1.211,-1.175,-0.695,-0.902,-0.253,-1.413,-0.948,-1.004,-0.957,-0.917,2.626,1.65,-0.27,-0.815,3,4,1,1,1,1,4,2,1,1,2,1
right to just judge someone just because we different,-1.379,-1.387,-1.38,-1.243,-0.305,-0.397,-0.588,-1.401,-1.297,-0.925,-0.95,-1.125,1.368,1.493,0.368,-0.604,3,3,3,2,2,2,3,3,3,2,1,2
read the core resources of Korea like Korea hasn't is used to be a homogeneous country so,-0.74,-0.917,-0.848,-1.141,1.021,1.259,-0.984,-0.368,0.099,4.499,1.729,2.46,4.422,6.544,0.937,0.82,3,2,1,2,3,1,3,3,1,2,2,1
actually provide them provides them like comfort and safety,-1.623,-1.533,-1.482,-1.402,-0.39,-0.568,-2.968,-2.007,-0.963,-1.062,-1.263,-0.898,-0.092,-0.061,0.276,-1.184,3,3,2,2,2,1,2,3,1,1,1,2
stable economy and if you just look at the GDP,-0.94,-1.074,-0.723,-0.687,2.524,2.539,-0.132,0.172,-1.017,-0.681,-0.6,-0.575,0.86,2.493,1.233,-0.085,2,3,1,1,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1
and there also and I think it's their responsibility,-1.425,-1.319,-1.518,-1.343,-0.096,-0.649,0.614,-1.246,-1.452,-1.44,-1.402,-1.29,0.162,-0.432,-2.184,-1.877,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,2,2,2
the keep increasing until now and also I think it will,-1.635,-1.156,-1.555,-1.394,-0.71,-0.967,-1.089,-1.833,-1.115,-1.108,-1.191,-1.136,0.539,-0.227,-1.754,-1.525,3,3,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,2,1,2
you said it's a slow proportion and maybe it is,-1.579,-1.544,-1.476,-1.419,0.186,-0.435,-2.644,-2.029,-0.812,0.441,-1.33,-0.841,2.505,0.674,-0.005,-1.014,3,3,2,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,2
on is also already rigorous for that because of the,-1.2,-1.114,-1.063,-0.936,1.526,0.502,-1.357,-1.524,-1.548,-1.477,-1.407,-1.336,-0.08,-0.458,-1.574,-1.796,3,4,1,1,2,1,3,4,2,1,2,1
turmoil it cannot take responsibility for these people therefore,1.132,0.002,0.685,0.567,0.407,-0.191,-0.528,0.641,-1.399,-1.467,-0.839,-1.255,0.295,-0.321,-2.295,-1.322,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
they actually put a refugee in the candidate they actually warned that they got to release the refugee from the can,-1.141,-1.382,-0.998,-1.208,1.143,0.827,0.444,-1.235,-0.18,2.089,-0.858,0.602,1.707,1.995,-0.489,0.456,4,2,1,1,3,1,3,2,1,1,2,1
they are very real threat to safety of women in Korea because,-1.624,-1.425,-1.499,-1.402,-0.808,-1.02,-2.589,-1.527,-0.748,0.472,-0.335,-0.93,-0.056,0.56,0.889,-1.097,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,1,3,1
Romania talking about people that are escaping a crisis and what we can see is that,-1.402,-1.089,-1.385,-1.072,1.839,0.164,-0.26,-1.042,-1.597,-1.448,-1.528,-1.41,-0.722,-1.051,-2.657,-1.643,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
not tourist attraction but if they live they,-1.21,-1.056,-1.315,-1.116,1.07,0.366,0.075,-0.925,-1.668,-1.63,-1.179,-1.451,-0.83,-1.208,-2.371,-2.113,2,3,2,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1

so I think so yeah I also accept that,-1.397,-0.499,-1.249,-1.061,1.27,-0.018,0.235,-1.148,-0.649,-1.257,-1.042,-0.831,0.749,0.27,0.479,-0.542,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,4,2,1,2,1

to wrap it up just saying that,-1.482,-0.857,-1.444,-1.226,0.099,-0.645,-1.865,-1.774,-1.312,-1.42,-1.444,-1.295,-0.356,-0.889,-1.66,-1.52,3,2,1,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,3,1
so,-1.362,-0.899,-1.443,-1.247,1.046,-0.171,-0.738,-0.094,-1.458,-1.271,-1.406,-1.24,-0.154,0.059,-1.489,-1.558,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,2,2,2
to accept refugees and,-1.04,-1.11,-1.354,-0.751,2.817,0.453,-0.131,-1.493,-1.443,-1.275,-1.425,-1.333,-0.479,-0.471,-1.272,-1.792,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,2,2,2

I think people are focusing way too much on what to have these people inside,-0.898,-0.863,-0.903,-1.142,1.607,0.963,0.702,-1.189,-1.278,-0.745,-1.222,-1.333,0.765,0.643,0.858,-0.611,2,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1

and also the second point is that because of the mass in flux,0.566,0.507,-0.585,-0.794,4.341,3.344,2.723,-0.166,-1.327,-1.323,-1.271,-1.223,-0.458,-0.437,-1.69,-1.517,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
case according to what you mentioned so it's these people don't have,1.654,-0.034,1.396,1.352,1.072,0.386,2.394,0.994,-1.507,-1.435,-1.484,-1.381,-0.839,-0.932,-2.45,-1.786,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
ran away from it they don't want to participate in the war and they were basically,-1.482,-1.562,-1.544,-1.367,-0.995,-1.119,-0.829,-1.879,-1.249,-1.4,-1.423,-1.276,-0.785,-0.654,-1.978,-1.814,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,1,1

Korea is a country for Koreans and we should respect the Korean citizens,-1.344,-1.431,-1.285,-1.277,-0.108,-0.436,-1.709,-1.384,-1.454,-1.504,-1.443,-1.353,-0.771,-0.703,-2.849,-1.851,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1

I think it's to do with the cultural thing,-1.511,-1.251,-1.294,-1.326,1.807,0.115,-1.077,-1.674,-1.417,-1.418,-1.309,-1.402,-0.088,-0.172,-1.77,-1.888,2,3,2,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
with compared with same,-1.481,-1.317,-1.463,-1.379,-0.603,-1.001,-1.488,-1.88,-1.506,-1.563,-1.436,-1.318,-0.955,-1.183,-2.969,-2.068,3,4,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
because I think Germany and France and Greece,-1.069,-0.98,-1.343,-1.233,0.126,0.449,-1.677,-1.615,0.816,-0.508,0.41,0.882,5.573,5.534,0.149,0.304,4,3,1,1,3,1,3,2,1,1,2,1
against accepting the refugees and,-0.308,-0.988,-0.424,0.381,-0.273,-0.417,-0.033,-0.565,-1.274,-1.204,-1.298,-1.155,-0.42,-0.451,-2.813,-1.474,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
high in jobs that pay well that will get them ready for the society for marriage for example,-1.459,-0.854,-1.211,-1.29,1.512,1.851,0.235,-1.415,-1.353,-1.137,-1.426,-1.189,0.189,-0.773,-0.617,-1.681,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
that is not comparable I would say because it's for attention,-1.291,-1.033,-1.281,-1.276,0.735,0.913,-1.384,-1.666,-1.653,-1.635,-1.552,-1.423,-0.862,-1.205,-2.595,-2.012,3,4,2,2,2,1,3,2,2,1,1,1
take there's up in foreign country and also as use,-1.466,-1.052,-1.211,-1.272,1.024,-0.091,-0.999,-1.568,-1.325,-1.41,-1.048,-1.326,-0.242,-0.664,-2.645,-1.926,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
refugee inside the camp they don't let the few Fuji outside of the camp I didn't even know what,-1.166,-0.936,-1.174,-1.241,0.835,0.652,-0.478,-0.918,-0.581,-0.806,-1.222,-1.034,-0.558,-0.93,0.179,-1.65,4,2,1,1,2,1,3,2,1,1,2,1
should be learning so although they're like 550 people if you,-1.552,-1.46,-1.488,-1.322,-0.544,-0.583,-1.084,-1.746,-0.76,-1.147,-1.136,-1.114,-0.257,-0.402,-1.857,-1.59,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
difference Germany and yeah I think they should let the immigrants in,-0.192,-0.645,-1.027,-0.813,2.619,0.75,1.455,-0.229,-1.319,-1.249,-1.262,-1.172,-0.597,-0.671,-1.583,-1.576,2,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
primary bigger point of view there's,-1.651,-1.58,-1.575,-1.422,-0.701,-0.865,-1.479,-1.967,-0.891,-0.553,-1.057,-1.115,0.451,-0.096,-1.742,-0.231,4,4,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
as you know Korea Korea has like consist creates consists of like only 12 people like which is,-0.391,-0.133,-0.563,-0.942,2.141,2.94,-0.79,-0.653,-1.21,-1.239,-1.485,-1.312,-0.775,-0.958,-1.038,-1.7,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
them then it is against the Constitution,-1.147,-1.201,-1.371,-1.328,-0.745,-0.732,-0.28,-1.782,-1.582,-1.462,-1.461,-1.318,-0.933,-1.081,-2.909,-1.95,4,4,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
Labour's and thing is in Western countries its poor even for the unemployed people,-1.599,-1.579,-1.463,-1.28,0.04,-0.479,-3.059,-2.107,-1.542,-1.388,-1.334,-0.92,-0.061,-0.412,-1.781,-1.25,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,4,3,1,1,1
disagree that with you because although there are many people,-1.372,-1.155,-1.297,-1.21,-0.4,-0.814,-1.406,-1.823,-1.138,-1.363,-1.226,-1.161,0.037,-0.117,-1.497,-1.542,3,3,1,2,1,1,4,3,1,1,2,1
against these refugees but I believe this issue is not,-0.681,-1.04,-0.569,-0.4,-0.447,-0.003,-0.473,-0.119,-1.156,-1.246,-1.198,-1.123,-0.367,-0.169,-0.498,-1.655,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
my second point is that the people are mainly,-1.01,-0.551,-1.284,-1.134,1.255,-0.017,0.772,-1.531,-1.347,-0.594,-1.247,-1.286,1.748,0.467,-1.453,-1.71,2,3,2,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,1
interests so each person in the world is part of a country there are citizens,-1.027,-1.004,-1.214,-1.193,0.209,0.24,-0.759,-1.059,-0.914,-1.497,-1.339,-1.197,-0.275,-0.515,-2.736,-2.042,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,1,1
overall I like against this accepting the refugees,0.782,-0.199,-0.018,0.112,-0.008,-0.523,-0.184,-0.998,-1.356,-1.375,-1.552,-1.29,-0.819,-1.075,-2.553,-1.924,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
which is like there's,-1.585,-1.457,-1.495,-1.319,0.11,-0.427,-2.182,-1.78,-1.132,-1.161,-1.145,-0.917,-0.081,1.064,-0.586,-1.554,3,4,2,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
because let me think about all those crises originated from is from,-1.644,-1.338,-1.527,-1.301,0.071,-0.534,-1.214,-1.758,-1.247,-1.296,-1.31,-0.919,-0.119,-0.191,-1.21,-1.681,3,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
but if that doesn't but that's not that's quite realistically,-0.213,1.521,-0.578,-0.843,2.404,1.459,-0.031,-0.309,-1.49,-0.877,-1.434,-1.297,-0.635,-0.566,-1.226,-1.191,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
of just because they are you know there are a lot of issues like safety,-1.576,-1.327,-1.407,-1.287,-0.969,-1.146,-2.438,-1.58,-1.246,-1.386,-1.201,-1.264,-0.044,-0.75,-0.881,-1.44,3,2,1,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,3,1
we're sorting that I were taking away more of the pie which would even increase the crisis between,-1.563,-1.411,-1.451,-1.324,-0.587,-0.857,-1.719,-1.831,-1.229,-0.841,-1.319,-1.165,0.698,0.243,-1.796,-1.416,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
it's not as if,-1.336,-1.125,-1.226,-0.935,0.271,0.254,-0.459,-1.63,-1.624,-1.389,-1.465,-1.247,0.559,-0.031,-0.832,-1.511,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
fine why so because,-1.234,-1.322,-1.223,-1.212,-0.008,-0.215,-1.901,-1.832,-1.349,-1.032,-1.188,-1.085,1.044,0.414,0.359,-0.553,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
arrived in this especially in many Arab Jesus arrived in,-0.239,-0.388,-0.818,-0.559,-0.543,-0.595,-0.274,-1.254,-1.208,-0.706,-1.127,-0.963,-0.575,-0.686,-0.58,-1.333,2,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
set their phones so you're saying you don't want to be like controversial,-1.563,-1.565,-1.56,-1.415,-0.76,-1.146,-1.983,-1.961,-1.04,-0.978,-0.42,-0.764,2.54,1.171,0.133,-0.427,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,1,1
really do not know what the topic is,-0.958,-1.044,-0.879,-1.187,0.937,2.031,-0.395,-0.646,-1.184,-1.387,-1.302,-1.181,0.66,-0.203,0.345,-0.656,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
Mainland and was on the news report so I don't think there will be confined to the Jesuit,-1.407,-1.226,-1.503,-1.311,-0.365,-0.797,-0.906,-1.463,-1.437,-1.476,-1.308,-1.141,-0.014,-0.444,-0.194,-1.582,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,4,2,1,1,1
like they also deal to provide some settlement like how to do,-1.141,-0.976,-1.325,-1.144,1.587,-0.311,-1.355,-0.752,-1.45,-1.074,-1.424,-1.281,-0.026,-0.315,-1.252,-1.465,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
I like to disagree on how he said that Korea,-1.537,-1.171,-1.398,-1.317,-0.665,-0.905,-1.816,-1.884,-1.443,-1.445,-1.426,-1.378,-0.616,-0.897,-0.419,-1.483,4,3,1,2,1,1,3,2,1,1,1,1
you talk about other kind,-1.467,-0.718,-1.317,-1.41,-0.168,-0.096,-0.69,-1.166,1.473,1.174,2.806,0.232,6.701,8.558,1.093,0.905,2,2,1,1,3,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
so,0.053,-0.521,-0.089,0.051,-0.272,-0.027,-0.864,-1.116,-0.342,-0.359,0.241,-0.228,0.761,1.434,0.927,-0.224,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
fear-mongering population yet South Korea should get,-0.964,-1.043,-1.238,-1.306,-0.189,-0.548,0.116,-1.432,-1.176,-0.989,-0.858,-1.166,0.318,3.291,-0.123,-1.361,3,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
point like there should be some like strict regulation that actually built,-1.095,-0.575,-1.36,-1.14,-0.131,-0.114,-1.003,-0.078,-0.617,-1.331,-1.333,-1.185,-0.048,-0.274,2.048,-0.533,2,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,3,1
first,-0.525,-0.757,-0.509,-0.419,-0.362,-0.412,-0.68,-0.973,-1.523,-1.075,-1.296,-1.165,0.296,-0.525,0.031,-1.507,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
I've talked to many refugees so and and humanitarian statement they at least,-1.115,-0.897,-0.934,-0.873,1.121,0.333,-0.505,-1.455,-1.682,-1.585,-1.387,-1.341,-0.484,-0.949,-3.009,-2.055,4,3,1,2,1,1,3,2,1,1,1,1
yes I guess yeah that's one of them is good and no Koreans first cuz we are here,-1.186,-0.931,-1.289,-1.287,-0.165,-0.393,-0.296,-0.611,-1.288,-1.28,-1.471,-1.302,-0.852,-0.851,-2.347,-1.636,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
until even the 80s when the Western and Eastern combined so I'm not sure if that could be technically argued,-1.312,-1.477,-1.271,-1.303,0.911,0.71,-0.788,-1.408,-1.441,-1.545,-1.423,-1.277,0.241,-0.809,-1.595,-1.734,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
to the like the fisherman Tom to help the features catch the fish in the sea,-1.435,-0.882,-1.433,-1.11,0.681,0.127,-0.427,-1.388,-1.562,-1.344,-1.346,-1.366,-0.394,-0.184,-2.812,-1.95,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
from there over ten thousand Thirty thousands of people,-1.574,-1.122,-1.507,-1.155,-0.26,-0.623,-0.908,-1.823,-1.293,-1.349,-1.02,-0.992,0.952,0.731,-0.442,-0.872,3,4,1,1,2,1,4,4,2,1,1,1
helping the poor people is extremely different from Korea and victim,-1.15,0.428,-0.968,-1.06,3.209,2.838,0.144,1.2,-1.668,-1.615,-1.4,-1.374,-0.339,-0.523,-2.719,-1.83,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
in other words I keep on going back to the point saying we don't have a large in a resource,-1.36,-1.298,-1.514,-1.387,-0.85,-1.003,-2.076,-1.98,-1.496,-1.556,-1.455,-1.315,-0.17,-0.697,-2.454,-1.959,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
other other,-1.478,-1.501,-1.364,-1.291,0.281,-0.015,-2.285,-1.765,-1.354,-0.837,-1.407,-1.261,0.05,-0.368,-0.987,-1.511,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
also she has argued that they should be accepted after South Korea's ready for,-0.78,0.471,-0.684,-1.127,1.351,1.588,-0.876,-1.055,-1.475,-1.25,-1.124,-1.336,0.508,0.048,-2.479,-1.803,4,3,1,2,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1
your daily people could realistically go to Ocean First consider the wires it is happening,-1.387,-1.351,-1.345,-1.262,0.389,-0.397,-0.819,-1.408,-1.458,-1.572,-1.521,-1.33,-0.468,-1.062,-2.023,-1.719,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
well you said that it is really irregular,-1.248,-0.619,-1.125,-1.187,-0.627,-1.101,-1.723,-1.194,-0.382,1.017,0.518,0.661,5.69,3.014,-0.236,0.934,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
one or two were done by people that aren't French or Belgian nationality,-1.607,-1.499,-1.496,-1.363,0.011,-0.398,-2.353,-1.836,-1.236,-1.434,-1.381,-1.062,-0.157,-0.486,-2.586,-1.874,3,4,2,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1

and you said that like the youth unemployment problem is pretty big and like,-1.334,-1.508,-1.555,-1.323,-1.015,-1.237,-2.108,-1.843,-1.373,-1.336,-1.345,-1.299,-0.276,-0.489,-0.596,-1.683,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1

I think they could be viewed in the same way but from a Korean,-1.526,-1.57,-1.58,-1.389,-0.903,-1.174,-2.793,-1.94,-1.131,-1.363,-1.33,-1.279,0.02,-0.585,-2.421,-1.95,4,3,1,1,2,1,4,3,2,1,1,1

okay and then the other thing is Korea is,-1.289,-1.168,-1.267,-1.268,1.182,0.193,-0.24,-0.961,-1.184,-1.278,-1.194,-0.884,0.767,0.274,-2.104,-1.275,4,3,2,2,2,1,3,4,2,1,2,1
of Korea issue and I think me to take more care,-1.534,-1.554,-1.521,-1.375,-0.184,-0.903,-1.937,-1.759,-1.073,-1.539,-1.459,-1.23,-0.094,-0.63,-2.008,-1.762,3,2,1,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,3,1
well and in contrast Korea is only old as Korea,-1.641,-1.545,-1.414,-1.393,-0.234,-0.885,-2.55,-1.75,-0.985,-0.338,-1.112,-0.765,0.557,1.122,-0.117,-0.392,3,4,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,2,1
I think they're kind of abusing that system and second of all I think it's bit,-1.468,-1.237,-1.478,-1.383,0.005,-0.394,-1.165,-1.225,-1.387,-1.451,-1.45,-1.36,-0.767,-0.929,-2.593,-1.911,3,2,1,1,1,1,3,4,1,1,1,1
signed and if this was supposed to become an issue the government should not be responsible,-0.36,1.217,0.299,0.302,-0.04,0.029,0.002,-0.586,-1.35,-1.188,-1.41,-1.141,-0.025,-0.344,-0.977,-1.497,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
not the best way to be the good just for the country,-0.593,-0.878,-1.074,-0.926,2.538,3.267,0.512,1.924,-1.42,-1.468,-1.303,-1.285,1.788,0.26,-0.915,-1.502,4,3,1,1,2,1,4,4,2,1,2,1
and like my second reason was there's no reason why we the second reason and like my second reason was there's no reason why we,-1.514,-1.391,-1.405,-1.22,0.216,-0.589,-0.602,-1.47,-1.614,-1.278,-1.259,-1.32,-0.015,0.518,-1.248,-1.443,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,2,1
and even if there's a lot of problem we're basically comparing something,-1.458,-1.503,-1.461,-1.364,-0.128,-0.395,-1.013,-1.686,-1.537,-1.406,-1.44,-1.389,-0.204,-0.672,-2.748,-1.862,3,4,2,2,2,1,3,2,2,1,1,1

they do the same for for refugees be just because they look me from,-1.229,-0.894,-1.139,-1.116,0.865,0.417,-1.888,-0.619,-1.32,-1.358,-1.467,-1.278,0.205,-0.382,-1.154,-0.714,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,1,1

people coming in and especially Korea is one of the country that,-1.213,-1.195,-1.465,-1.234,-0.576,-0.99,-1.871,-1.845,-1.532,-1.242,-1.545,-1.355,-0.876,-1.023,-2.659,-1.908,3,2,2,2,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
"other countries such as Malaysia about 20,000 refugees stayed four 99-year",-0.905,-0.632,-1.168,-1.075,0.328,-0.369,0.942,-0.242,-1.486,-1.289,-1.533,-1.345,-0.872,-1.094,-1.722,-1.744,4,3,1,1,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
one of the way to increase the multi diversity not only,-0.589,0.053,-1.103,-0.958,2.627,0.744,-0.154,-0.618,-1.459,-1.519,-0.568,-1.254,-0.214,-0.748,-2.744,-1.945,2,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
so I'm out of breath from the article reassigned it 0.15 the,-1.364,-0.882,-1.267,-1.094,1.446,0.18,0.305,-1.059,-1.505,-1.581,-1.49,-1.296,-0.531,-0.882,-2.471,-1.891,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
as you can actually read from the article as well most of the opposing side,-1.26,-1.442,-1.275,-1.358,-0.099,-0.017,-0.414,-1.448,-1.678,-1.557,-1.608,-1.456,-1.039,-1.197,-2.665,-1.969,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,1
yeah and I guess I guess that's kind of TRUE but you know the other point is,-0.739,-0.935,-1.077,-1.068,0.654,0.957,-1.351,-0.709,-1.286,-1.543,-1.461,-1.331,-0.909,-1.133,-2.103,-1.634,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
if we educate the people on on the effects and also the not effects,-1.438,-0.998,-1.4,-1.235,-0.096,0.082,-1.742,-1.329,-1.367,-1.345,-1.507,-1.256,-0.357,-0.479,-1.094,-0.94,3,3,2,1,1,1,4,3,2,1,2,1

the ideal is good the idea of letting refugees in Turkey a country is good but,-1.684,-1.604,-1.557,-1.403,-0.984,-1.157,-2.501,-1.944,-1.702,-1.323,-1.418,-1.339,-0.66,-0.347,-1.177,-1.616,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,1,1
people over love and beside I don't think this should be the or problem the core,-0.556,0.397,-0.708,-1.037,3.473,3.821,0.69,-1.031,-1.299,-1.263,-1.301,-1.097,-0.219,-0.554,0.225,-1.11,2,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
accepting these refugees because I was also and us before and then,-1.534,-1.404,-1.491,-1.382,-0.895,-1.148,-2.295,-1.951,-1.148,-1.288,-1.486,-1.275,-0.633,-0.648,-1.953,-1.287,2,3,1,2,2,1,3,4,1,1,3,1
very sensitive issue but I think that shouldn't discourage us from,-1.305,-1.049,-1.279,-1.241,0.937,0.033,-1.404,-1.556,-1.389,-1.165,-1.469,-1.227,0.406,-0.522,-1.639,-0.713,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
the problem in Yemen and many other countries that like Syria,-1.425,-1.527,-1.534,-1.345,-1.19,-1.273,-2.107,-1.587,-1.628,-1.421,-1.496,-1.378,-0.152,-0.438,-2.057,-1.954,3,4,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,2,1
ever experienced in the 20th 21st century and,-1.149,-1.086,-1.423,-1.183,-0.57,-0.935,-0.557,-1.548,-1.506,-1.602,-1.58,-1.41,-0.716,-1.036,-0.559,-1.791,3,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,2,1
up to mulch Multicultural Concepts and all that so people here,-1.127,-0.188,-1.238,-0.926,-0.683,-0.948,0.581,-1.597,-0.646,-1.302,-1.137,-1.279,0.137,-0.771,-0.887,-1.492,2,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
most of the students are against the refugee because cauldrons bit different and they cause like,-1.562,-0.959,-1.538,-1.311,-0.123,-0.332,-0.309,-1.56,-1.128,-1.077,-1.054,-1.255,0.566,0.133,-0.462,-1.279,4,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1
so I would like,-0.733,-0.845,-0.881,-1.104,2.281,1.823,1.523,-0.711,-0.778,-0.934,-0.507,-1.198,1.702,1.301,-0.539,-1.415,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,2,1
I,-1.012,-1.028,-0.653,-1.229,0.565,0.851,-1.101,-1.068,-1.2,-1.05,-1.34,-1.247,-0.129,-0.536,-0.078,-1.453,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,1
for this comment about a researcher is and also the some highlighter,-0.615,0.417,-0.618,-0.314,6.91,3.578,1.412,0.755,-1.05,-0.687,-1.133,-1.095,0.281,0.24,1.494,-0.851,3,4,1,1,1,1,3,4,2,1,2,1
yes you could make it but then I like to ask what kind of practical,-1.553,-1.475,-1.539,-1.195,-0.474,-0.918,-2.06,-1.863,-1.316,-0.88,-1.061,-0.758,2.826,0.107,-0.373,-0.683,3,3,1,2,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
the interest of his people and I don't think it's a bad thing that,-0.926,-0.798,-1.245,-0.555,0.843,0.05,-0.073,-0.353,-1.43,-1.41,-1.382,-1.305,0.408,-0.272,-2.43,-1.97,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,1,1
who need help from the government who can't sustain the,-1.408,-1.347,-1.369,-1.189,1.355,0.42,-0.266,-1.456,-1.513,-1.532,-1.46,-1.28,-0.587,-0.787,-1.627,-1.998,4,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,1,1
actually in case of Germany they have already experienced,-1.425,-1.251,-1.385,-1.278,-0.525,-0.354,-1.411,-1.717,-1.07,-1.137,-1.417,-1.312,-0.752,-0.965,-0.802,-1.55,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
like you say that there are already many foreigners,-1.43,-1.424,-1.339,-1.319,-0.122,-0.464,-1.513,-1.828,-1.087,-0.49,-1.114,-1.15,2.093,2.065,-0.402,-0.663,3,3,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
and then becomes like a global issue,-1.377,-1.178,-1.498,-1.288,-0.506,-0.754,-1.157,-1.596,-1.373,-1.289,-1.375,-1.35,-0.533,-0.672,-0.625,-1.471,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,3,1
my main argument my been argument here is that by putting,-1.268,-1.041,-1.22,-1.115,0.456,0.397,-1.058,-1.025,0.154,0.301,0.574,1.282,7.004,8.787,0.145,1.4,4,3,1,1,2,1,3,2,1,1,2,1
have the highest possibility of being spies right so in that kind of view yemenis,-1.685,-1.23,-1.517,-1.389,-0.992,-1.098,-1.738,-1.776,-1.247,-1.422,-1.158,-1.088,0.725,0.227,0.27,-0.452,3,3,1,1,1,1,4,3,2,1,1,1
maybe you could you know affect economic side it's hard,-1.601,-1.242,-0.931,-0.953,0.946,0.3,-2.026,-0.981,-1.465,-1.013,-1.381,-1.217,0.618,-0.401,-1.059,-1.473,3,2,1,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,2,1
