arrived in this especially in many Arab Jesus arrived in,10.0,1.667,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,10.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
Jeju Allah first of all I want to mention that the current,15.0,2.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,15.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
movement in South Korea against against this year many refugees are,20.0,2.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,20.0,3.667,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
pretty much standard phobic activity because,25.0,2.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,25.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
right now those refugees are arrived and those refugees arrived in Jeju,30.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,30.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
Island and are under intense examination of whether they are really lawful refugees and their Korean law or not,35.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,35.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
and of course since they well at least,40.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,40.0,4.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
they're claiming that they are fleeing from those conflicts and persecution and we all know that Yemen has,45.0,2.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,45.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
currently undergoing this Civil War and we I know that if I call,50.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,50.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
it says they do have some threats in their own country,55.0,2.333,2.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,55.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
and yeah we have to of course we have to examine the fact that whether they are,60.0,2.333,2.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,60.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
really facing thus those threats by themselves in their Nation,65.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,65.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
by person by person but it's all they guaranteed,70.0,2.667,2.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,70.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
or is their right to be examined fairly under those,75.0,2.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,75.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
under those posts asses and loss stand loss,80.0,2.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,80.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
for for Korea being under the UN Refugee Convention,85.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,85.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
as they've just signed they like several tens of years ago they create,90.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,90.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
do have an obligation to fairly examine and if they are lawful but if you have,95.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,95.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
to accept it,100.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,100.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
yeah so,105.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,105.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
overall I like against this accepting the refugees,110.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,110.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
currently in Jeju largely because a lot of the population is not,115.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,115.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
agreeing to it or accepting it already seven hundred thousand people signed a petition to the blue house,120.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,120.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
against accepting the refugees and,125.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,125.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
the difference I guess when you're talking about xenophobia is,130.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,130.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
there already 2 million foreigners leave living illegally in Korea right now,135.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,135.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
the reason people are against it would be more because these people,140.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,140.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
without visas cannot be accounted for but their actions the country itself because it seems such,145.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,145.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
turmoil it cannot take responsibility for these people therefore,150.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,150.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
they're more reluctant to accepting these people so it's hard to say is,155.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,155.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
racist or xenophobia data to and this,160.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,160.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
there's this General lack of trust of the Korean government especially for the young,165.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,165.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
adults that the Korean government is not particular of its own citizens,170.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,170.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
so it should pay more attention and make sure that it does not own citizens,175.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,175.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
don't feel that the treatment towards refugees are unfair compared to the people,180.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,180.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
who have the nationality and will have citizenship of the country already,185.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,185.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
first,190.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,190.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
of all you mentioned that,195.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,195.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
s okay so well you,200.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,200.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
mentioned that a lot of Korean citizens are against it and as a,205.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,205.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
as an Evidence you showed the petition that number of the petitioners in foreign,210.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,210.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
against these refugees but I believe this issue is not,215.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,215.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
really a democratic issue that can be decided upon the popular Theory votes it is the legal,220.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,220.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
right to be examined under a fair and Justice law because it is a law we,225.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,225.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
I mean it is also kind of an International Love Me Korea sign like several tens of years,230.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,230.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
ago and we promise to the international society that we are going,235.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,235.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0

emotional or personal personal feelings,250.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,250.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
against these refugees or in general against work for foreigners coming in,255.0,2.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,255.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
the country but well I think that's not really the issue in this case and,260.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,260.0,3.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0

also mentioned that they're already legal legally residing two million foreign people,270.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,270.0,3.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
in South Korea and what I want what I just want to mention is that they're not,275.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,275.0,3.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
illegal immigrants are just under a process so well it's not really,280.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,280.0,3.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
it's really hard to say very illegal he's just in the in between that process in between those,285.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,285.0,3.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
fetuses and well you also mentioned,290.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,290.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
about the responsibilities that the South Korea doesn't hold the responsibility to take care of this,295.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,295.0,3.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0

and we do have a responsibility for that right,305.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,305.0,3.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
so repeatedly you've mentioned the law but the agreement,310.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,310.0,3.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
that tree has signed impact in 1994 which is more than 20 years ago,315.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,315.0,3.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
and what we but I want to point out is that if this law,320.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,320.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0

to educate the people prior to this,330.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,330.0,3.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
disagreement happening so at this point people are not ready to accept the people,335.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,335.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
although the government has taken the choice to sign the agreement the,340.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,340.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
general population was not aware and the failure of the government to YouTube operation educate the,345.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,345.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0

there was no problem in maintaining that particular acceptance rate if,375.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,375.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.333
he applied that acceptance rate to the current situation there should be no more problem although there's a sudden,380.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,380.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.333

than what he had done previously without a safe angry life,395.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,395.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0

the government holds the responsibility to educate at least people,420.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,420.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0

curse and the book wasn't just a signpost okay I'll get this money and you just go that,480.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,480.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
country so well it's not really their choices of arriving to judge you Allen and,485.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,485.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
in that case we do have to consider the humanitarian and their Refugee status and,490.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,490.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
Refugee status legally and lawfully in South Korea,495.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,495.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
so,500.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,500.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
once again the,505.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,505.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
we repeat the point that there was a sudden increase of from 41,510.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,510.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
people to over 500 people refugees suddenly coming to Korea,515.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,515.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
although we have maintained a very low make the acceptance rate and the Brokers,520.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,520.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
should have been aware of that however they did not take responsibility in your in your,525.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,525.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
case according to what you mentioned so it's these people don't have,530.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,530.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
a choice but so does Korea Korea it's not ready,535.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,535.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
for accepting me more than two point four percent at the moment because currently again once again we,540.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,540.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
have not had strict policies about higher acceptance rates or in case,545.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,545.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
of sudden a incoming of a large number of people in the general,550.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,550.0,3.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
population was not aware,555.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,555.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
we are doing everything that is legal,560.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,560.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
in terms of examining the people and making sure that the right people,565.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,565.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
but you cannot say that the attitude of unpreparedness,570.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,570.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
it's wrong and that this is the natural reaction of the people in Korea,575.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,575.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
you have to accept that I think,580.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,580.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
someone here are you,585.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,585.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
okay,590.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,590.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
so,595.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,595.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
well since this is my final remarks I,600.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,600.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
just want to mention it briefly about the whole argument of myself so I do,605.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,605.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
think that we have to accept more I mean at least in this case you have to,610.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,610.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
accept or after the thorough examination we have to accept this Romanian refugees arrived in Jeju Island,615.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,615.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
and well of course as I mentioned over and,620.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,620.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
over again it's all based on Refugee Convention as we have signed in 1994,625.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,625.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
it is our promise to the international Society at that we are going to accept the refugees,630.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,630.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
then it is also it's not really one-sided it's intervene a fishery for example if something happens,635.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,635.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
in Korea and if Korean people is case South Korea for,640.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,640.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
areas of different reasons about the threats well we redo,645.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,645.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
it's packed that other nations who scientists fashion except ourselves,650.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,650.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
as a refugee and just like we may accept,655.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,655.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
this your minion work which is right now in the southern coast of 2018 so yeah,660.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,660.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
I do urge them you have to assign more and more research has to this Romanian refugees at least,665.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,665.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
and of course it should be all based on the legal legal boundary we have to,670.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,670.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
examine their urgent needs and whether they are really in threat in there,675.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,675.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
but yeah in that process those refugees,680.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,680.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
should be guaranteed those humanitarian issues like they're eating sand clothing,685.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,685.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
staff also lawful and fair processes,690.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,690.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
all,695.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,695.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
right overall once again I want to repeat that I'm,700.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,700.0,3.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
against accepting the refugees currently in Jeju for entering America,705.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,705.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
and although the Korea Korea has signed a petition,710.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,710.0,3.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
the agreement to accept refugees in the past but,715.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,715.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
the nation itself decides how much how many people enter the country,720.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,720.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
and it has done a very well good job mate meaning the low number considering,725.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,725.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
its monocultural society and the single race mess of Korea,730.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,730.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
and how it is like,735.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,735.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
it is balancing is trying its best to balance the amount of,740.0,2.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,740.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
effort and research has gone into the it's balancing trying its best to balance the amount of effort and resources gone into the own citizens compared,745.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,745.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
to the foreigners for entering without prior notice,750.0,2.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,750.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
and they're doing its best to balance out and currently the conditions,755.0,2.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,755.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
are not on that own citizens compared to the foreigners for entering without prior notice and they're doing its best to balance out and currently the conditions are not that you want to be able to,760.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,760.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
fully take care of the refugees in large amounts so we are not ready yet to,765.0,2.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,765.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0

should also accept the consequences that are Korean government has such a,775.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,775.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
limited okay experience is over,780.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,780.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
okay so the reason why she's just drove for,5.0,1.667,3.0,1.333,1.667,2.0,1.0,5.0,2.667,3.667,1.333,1.333,2.333,1.0
accepting these refugees because I was also and us before and then,10.0,1.667,3.0,1.333,1.667,2.0,1.0,10.0,2.667,3.667,1.333,1.333,2.667,1.0
you know even even us it's one of the country that says a lot of refugees from other countries,15.0,1.667,3.0,1.333,1.667,2.0,1.0,15.0,3.0,4.0,1.667,1.333,2.333,1.0
than as a foreigner stare like there I was in a,20.0,1.667,3.0,1.333,1.667,2.0,1.0,20.0,3.0,4.0,1.333,1.333,2.667,1.0
university called pencil pencil and then there are a lot of,25.0,1.667,2.667,1.333,1.667,2.0,1.0,25.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.333,2.667,1.0
international students and there are a lot of there were a lot of friends who,30.0,2.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,30.0,2.667,3.667,1.333,1.333,2.667,1.0
are from like those Arab or like near Arab countries,35.0,2.333,2.333,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,35.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.333,2.667,1.0
and see like they have a,40.0,2.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,40.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.333,2.667,1.0
lot of issues about getting B's as and getting deported from the country,45.0,2.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,45.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.333,2.667,1.333
that was the beginning of this empathy,50.0,2.667,2.0,1.0,1.667,2.0,1.0,50.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.333,2.667,1.333
about this issue,55.0,2.667,2.0,1.0,1.667,2.0,1.0,55.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.333,2.667,1.333
the painting is that not accepting all these refugees,60.0,2.333,2.0,1.0,1.667,2.0,1.0,60.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.333,2.667,1.333
of just because they are you know there are a lot of issues like safety,65.0,2.667,2.0,1.0,1.667,2.0,1.0,65.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.667,1.333
issues or or maybe like economic problems,70.0,2.333,2.0,1.0,1.667,2.0,1.0,70.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.667,1.333
it's not good to generalize this people in,75.0,2.333,2.0,1.0,1.667,2.0,1.0,75.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.667,1.333
some way,80.0,2.667,2.0,1.667,1.667,1.667,1.0,80.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.667,1.333
yeah so that's kind of Baseline,85.0,2.667,2.0,1.667,1.667,1.667,1.0,85.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.667,1.0
begin to not generalize the certain people,90.0,2.667,2.0,1.667,1.667,1.667,1.0,90.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.667,1.333
hey so,95.0,2.667,2.0,1.667,1.667,1.667,1.0,95.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.667,1.333
I'm against something is Emily refugees in Korea,100.0,2.667,2.0,1.667,1.667,1.667,1.0,100.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.667,1.333
generally speaking,105.0,3.0,2.0,1.667,1.667,1.667,1.0,105.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.667,1.333
these refugees the refugee by,110.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,2.0,2.0,1.0,110.0,2.0,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
the meaning of refugee is that they have some problems in their country they,115.0,3.667,3.333,1.667,2.0,2.0,1.0,115.0,2.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
are endangered by certain issues related to their,120.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,2.0,2.0,1.0,120.0,2.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
religious or some political issues and these,125.0,3.667,3.333,1.667,2.0,2.0,1.0,125.0,2.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
yemenite yemeni refugees who came into,130.0,3.667,3.333,1.667,2.0,2.0,1.0,130.0,2.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
Jeju Island are there,135.0,3.667,3.333,1.667,2.0,2.0,1.0,135.0,2.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0

we speculate that majority have come to Korea for just,145.0,3.667,3.333,1.667,2.0,2.0,1.0,145.0,2.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
for work and they don't they didn't come,150.0,3.667,3.333,1.667,2.0,2.333,1.0,150.0,2.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
as general,155.0,3.333,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.333,1.0,155.0,2.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
legitimate route Korea whether they chose to complicate their come here as,160.0,3.333,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.333,1.0,160.0,2.0,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
a refugee certainly people that really hire,165.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.333,1.0,165.0,2.0,3.333,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
to get accepted as a refugee but,170.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.333,1.0,170.0,1.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
the majority I speculate that they're not,175.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.333,1.0,175.0,1.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
they don't have truthful intentions so,180.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.333,1.0,180.0,1.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
I would and those people could cause as you have mentioned,185.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.333,1.0,185.0,1.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
some safety issues as well as economic issues creosote,190.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.333,1.0,190.0,1.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
in general I am against accepting those that position,195.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.333,1.0,195.0,1.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
so to mention about the safety,200.0,2.333,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.333,1.0,200.0,1.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
issues and maybe combination is first of all for the safety issues like I see,205.0,3.333,3.667,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.0,205.0,1.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
that those people in Jeju Island they fear about those know like,210.0,3.333,3.667,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.0,210.0,1.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.333
they might read in some way or like some,215.0,2.667,3.667,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.0,215.0,2.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.333
yeah many different things but from the articles that we,220.0,2.333,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.0,220.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
got from the email they say like they're only like six five to six,225.0,2.333,2.333,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,225.0,2.667,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
incidents while more than half was about due to their,230.0,2.333,2.333,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,230.0,2.667,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
over it imagination just because it's there,235.0,2.333,2.333,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,235.0,2.667,3.333,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
and it's I think that's kind of typical,240.0,2.333,2.333,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,240.0,2.667,3.333,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
reaction due to the xenophobia or they don't like,245.0,2.333,2.333,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,245.0,2.667,3.333,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
people coming in and especially Korea is one of the country that,250.0,2.667,2.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,250.0,3.333,3.333,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
just lights like pure Koreans and I think,255.0,2.667,2.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,255.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.333
you know this behavior of,260.0,2.667,2.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,260.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.333
suspect suspicious being suspicious about,265.0,2.667,2.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,265.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.333
those people just because they're like,270.0,2.667,2.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,270.0,2.667,3.333,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
refugees to just blame them as like a you know they,275.0,2.667,2.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,275.0,2.667,3.333,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
might do this they might do the bad things I think there,280.0,2.333,2.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,280.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
is not enough,285.0,2.333,2.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,285.0,3.333,2.667,2.0,1.333,2.333,1.0
TRUE for say like a lot of,290.0,2.667,2.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,290.0,2.667,2.667,2.0,1.333,2.333,1.0
incidents that really proves that they're the bad guys that affects,295.0,2.0,2.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,295.0,3.0,2.667,2.0,1.333,2.333,1.0
Jeju people Worst Behavior,300.0,2.0,2.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,300.0,2.667,2.667,2.0,1.333,2.333,1.0
I'll just okay,305.0,2.0,2.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,305.0,2.667,2.333,1.667,1.333,2.667,1.333
so talking about proof that's very important of course we don't have any proof,310.0,2.667,2.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,310.0,2.667,2.0,1.333,1.0,2.667,1.667
that they will do something they will commit a crime in Korea but,315.0,2.333,2.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,315.0,2.667,2.0,1.333,1.0,3.0,1.667
we should be more cautious from the beginning,320.0,2.0,2.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,320.0,2.667,2.0,1.333,1.0,2.667,1.667
before something happens so it's not bad think to,325.0,2.333,2.333,1.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,325.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,1.0,2.667,1.667
be cautious in these what could be a greater issue in the future,330.0,2.333,2.333,1.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,330.0,2.667,2.0,1.333,1.0,2.667,1.667
after the well then discard really takes place also,335.0,2.667,2.333,1.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,335.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.333
when upon accepting these refugees,340.0,2.667,2.0,1.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,340.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.333
much more refugees will try to come to Korea and,345.0,2.667,3.333,1.667,1.333,1.333,1.0,345.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.333
actually in case of Germany they have already experienced,350.0,2.667,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,350.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.333
this issue and they they have accepted nearly like 1,355.0,2.667,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,355.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.333
million refugees already and they are causing social and economic,360.0,2.667,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,360.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.333
problems so they already regret it,365.0,2.667,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,365.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.333
but it's already it's already happened so they can't do anything about it,370.0,2.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,370.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.333
so thank talked about proof again,375.0,2.667,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,375.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.333,1.333
I really strongly recommend would think that those,380.0,2.667,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,380.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.333,1.333
refugees need to bring in their own proof that they are legitimate people,385.0,2.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,385.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.333,1.333
who have been in your advice and issues and,390.0,2.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,390.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.333,1.333
that they are they want to they want help from Korea and they want to contribute,395.0,3.0,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,395.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.333,1.333
to creating some way okay so you saying that there should be some way,400.0,2.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,400.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.667,1.333
to kind of filter on this like actual refugees right I also agree with the,405.0,2.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,405.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.667,1.333
point like there should be some like strict regulation that actually built,410.0,2.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,410.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.667,1.333
out for filters out those fake Ravens refugees but then,415.0,2.667,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,415.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.667,1.333
you know the thing is that when you just,420.0,2.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,420.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.667,1.333
so the main topic is about like being,425.0,2.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,425.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.667,1.333
like strictly against this refugees right so talking about that then,430.0,2.667,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,430.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.667,1.333
says I said there should be like some other ways,435.0,2.667,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,435.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,3.0,1.333
to sort out rather than just blocking all those refugees and,440.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,440.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.333,2.667,1.0
if you do love all those refugees because you know they're from the are upside people and then there are a lot,445.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,445.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.333,2.667,1.0
of other foreigners who like these days,450.0,2.667,2.667,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,450.0,3.333,2.667,1.667,1.333,2.667,1.0
only if it's a good example,455.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,455.0,3.333,2.667,1.667,1.333,2.667,1.0
but like Kpop for example there are a lot of fans in the other,460.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,460.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.333,2.667,1.0
this Asian side and even the oxide as well if we,465.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,465.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.333,2.667,1.0
you know if South Korea chooses to like lock the refugees,470.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,470.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.333,2.667,1.0
and then becomes like a global issue,475.0,2.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,475.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.333,2.667,1.0
in that sense you know it might affect Fame Alec,480.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,480.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.333,2.667,1.0
nothing but like reputation about Multicultural country,485.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,485.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.333,2.667,1.0
like South Korea is becoming one of the Multicultural country and there are a lot of,490.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,490.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.333,2.667,1.0
exports the other countries as well so,495.0,2.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,495.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.333,2.667,1.0
maybe you could you know affect economic side it's hard,500.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,500.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.333,1.0
to wrap it up just saying that,505.0,2.667,2.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,505.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.333,2.667,1.0
it's bad for okay okay so yes so you,510.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,510.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.333,2.667,1.0
partly agree that we should not totally accept these button to filter,515.0,2.667,2.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,515.0,2.333,2.667,1.667,1.333,2.667,1.0
out but totals blocking is wrong in that sense I agree,520.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,520.0,2.333,2.667,1.667,1.333,2.667,1.0
totally blocking is not right so that I said that,525.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,525.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.333,2.667,1.0
we need to filter out based on some evidence and,530.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,530.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.333,2.667,1.0
also like he talked about the image making image set image of Korea could be damaged by,535.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,535.0,2.667,2.667,2.0,1.333,2.333,1.0
total blocking of these refugees well yeah it could,540.0,2.667,2.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,540.0,3.0,2.667,2.0,1.333,2.333,1.0
so I also think that,545.0,2.667,2.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,545.0,3.0,2.667,2.0,1.333,2.333,1.0
image is important but that's out,550.0,2.667,2.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,550.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.333,2.667,1.0
of Korea issue and I think me to take more care,555.0,2.667,2.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,555.0,3.333,2.667,1.667,1.333,2.667,1.0
of inside issues where we can really experience,560.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,560.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.667,1.667,1.0
some issues really closely maybe ourselves,565.0,2.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,565.0,2.333,2.667,2.0,1.333,1.667,1.0
or even our parents were children so,570.0,2.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,570.0,2.333,2.667,2.0,1.333,1.667,1.0
I think safety issues that have been mentioned in the news and media could be exaggerated,575.0,2.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,575.0,2.333,2.667,2.0,1.333,1.667,1.0
but definitely it happened that's why it's in the news so,580.0,2.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,580.0,2.333,2.667,1.667,1.333,1.667,1.0
so I think those issues that we see,585.0,2.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,585.0,2.333,2.667,1.667,1.333,1.667,1.0
the news can really happen to us that's why I have to daughter,590.0,2.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,590.0,2.333,2.667,1.667,1.333,1.667,1.0
and I I'm a little worried not right now but for the future,595.0,2.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,595.0,2.333,2.333,1.333,1.667,2.333,1.0
if those things really happen what am I going to do,600.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,600.0,2.0,2.333,1.333,1.667,2.333,1.0
maybe I'm going to bring myself why did I agree to accept these refugees life and I go against it that it's already too,605.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,605.0,2.0,2.333,1.333,1.333,2.333,1.0
late so I think actual issues more important than the,610.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,610.0,2.0,2.333,1.333,1.333,2.333,1.0
image issues so,615.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,615.0,2.0,2.333,1.333,1.333,2.333,1.0
the debate is over,620.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,620.0,2.0,2.333,1.333,1.333,2.333,1.0
okay so which I'm trying to argue against the yemeni refugees,5.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,5.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
coming hurry up and think the strongest point that I can make is practically speaking the,10.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,10.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
resources high and South Korea is not big enough to take in any more foreigners and for labor force so,15.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,15.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
if they're coming for a tourist purpose they're actually being Spenders,20.0,3.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,20.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
their customers so they're actually increase resource pie with Korea,25.0,3.333,3.667,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,25.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
but then the thing is these people are coming in as refugees he wants to be letting so labor,30.0,3.0,3.667,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,30.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
force or thing is the unemployment rate in Korea is like,35.0,3.0,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,35.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
3% and then the young adult unemployment rate is shoots up,40.0,3.0,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,40.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
to an eight point eight percent so that really means that young people are having a hard time finding jobs,45.0,3.0,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,45.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
in other words I keep on going back to the point saying we don't have a large in a resource,50.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,50.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
so if we were to take in laborers,55.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,55.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
we're sorting that I were taking away more of the pie which would even increase the crisis between,60.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,60.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
young adults and the already employed labor force also then another point we can make,65.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,65.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
is these people are looking for cheaper or they are looking for these simple laborers,70.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,70.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
paying people for but then the thing is even that has become a problem,75.0,2.667,3.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,75.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
within the current government because the lowest possible,80.0,2.667,3.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,80.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
"wage the primary wage has gone up to almost 10,000",85.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,85.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
so a lot of young people are trying to get into these cheap laborers to if he,90.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,90.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
stays in other words they're practically is no bottom fruits,95.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,95.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
that these refugees can get into and therefore don't have space for these people,100.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,100.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
that's it for me so,105.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,105.0,3.333,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
I think I'm gonna jump in right into what you just said and stuff so basically,110.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,110.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
the main point which is taken into account in some,115.0,3.667,3.667,1.667,1.333,2.0,1.0,115.0,3.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
new source is that an ombre known in Korea is a problem,120.0,3.667,3.667,1.667,1.333,2.0,1.0,120.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
I would say that it's mostly TRUE but not really comparable to other developed,125.0,3.333,3.667,1.667,1.333,2.0,1.0,125.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
countries such as most of the westerners country actually South Korea has one of the lowest unemployment,130.0,3.333,3.667,2.0,1.333,1.667,1.0,130.0,3.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
rate and it is to be considered that the unemployment rate is as you said a lot of manual,135.0,3.0,3.667,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,135.0,3.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
jobs and as we can see in reports because it's missed,140.0,3.667,3.667,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,140.0,3.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
mostly like talking about Jeju Island all the foreigners right so we're,145.0,3.0,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,145.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.333
Romania talking about people that are escaping a crisis and what we can see is that,150.0,3.0,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,150.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.333
on this seminar we have a lot of seminar mainly,155.0,3.0,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,155.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
for for example fishing jobs and cooking jobs which are individual,160.0,3.667,3.667,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,160.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.333,2.0,1.0
and cannot provide and for example like they have whole amount,165.0,3.333,3.667,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,165.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.333,2.0,1.0
of maybe 500 refugees and over those 500,170.0,3.667,3.667,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,170.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.333,2.0,1.0
refugees or they already are the same they are about 170,175.0,3.333,3.667,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,175.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.333,2.0,1.0
170 jobs I think for fishing so there is I think there is definitely spots,180.0,3.333,3.667,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,180.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.333,2.0,1.0
for those jobs that are in are no longer taking because these drugs,185.0,3.667,3.667,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,185.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.333,2.0,1.0
are Maybe longer way from Seoul for example and long away,190.0,3.667,3.667,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,190.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.333,2.0,1.0
from families and I think that it's more over something more,195.0,3.667,3.667,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,195.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.333,2.0,1.0
humanitarian than economics even if the economics is to take into account,200.0,3.0,3.667,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,200.0,2.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
and as I say I don't think economics is really fun,205.0,3.667,3.667,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,205.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
I'm really glad that you brought into other countries into point because when comparing these,210.0,3.667,3.667,1.667,1.0,2.333,1.0,210.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
unemployment rates between countries it's also important to see what kind of humanitarian AIDS,215.0,3.667,3.667,1.667,1.0,2.333,1.0,215.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
most basic humanitarian rights that they give for their,220.0,3.0,3.667,1.667,1.0,2.667,1.0,220.0,3.0,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
Labour's and thing is in Western countries its poor even for the unemployed people,225.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,225.0,3.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
they take care of these people who they have all these different humanitarian AIDS if you were,230.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,230.0,3.333,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
to go to the state's you have the Health Equity well those of being bashed by Trump,235.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,235.0,3.333,4.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
of bed but then the thing is it's still there and then in the EU you,240.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,240.0,3.333,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
have these this inter connect enter Europe,245.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.333,1.667,1.0,245.0,3.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
human health policy that insures these people,250.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.333,1.667,1.0,250.0,3.333,3.333,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
how every other that's not really TRUE because unless you're actually a Korean citizen not,255.0,3.667,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,255.0,3.333,3.667,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
really getting all these three basic insurances so,260.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,260.0,3.667,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
these foreigners and although he's unemployed people they're not really getting insured,265.0,3.667,3.0,1.667,1.333,1.333,1.0,265.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
in Mattoon ways but you and that's because we don't have enough tax,270.0,3.667,2.667,1.333,1.667,1.333,1.0,270.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
money if that's something that comes from the text and it's hard to ensure these people,275.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.667,1.333,1.0,275.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
and then second novel like people escaping crisis well the humanitarian argument,280.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.667,1.333,1.0,280.0,3.333,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
yes you could make it but then I like to ask what kind of practical,285.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.667,1.333,1.0,285.0,3.333,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
benefit doll is being humanitarian bring to the country,290.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.667,1.333,1.0,290.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
so we can think of all the examples such as States bringing people from South America,295.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0,295.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
now they're dying that to and the reality European Refugee crisis which,300.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0,300.0,2.333,2.667,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
now is bringing a lot of terrorism and fights within the state of Europe,305.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0,305.0,2.333,2.667,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
as I mean not a lot but then there's still help me it's increased from the form,310.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,2.333,1.333,1.667,310.0,2.667,2.667,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
I would like,315.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,2.333,1.333,1.667,315.0,2.333,2.667,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
to take them say the last part which is mostly the first construed,320.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.333,1.667,320.0,2.667,2.667,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
the major blood I think the whole question of you,325.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.333,1.667,325.0,2.667,2.667,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
humanitarian needs more about what you want to be as a country and,330.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,2.333,1.667,1.667,330.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
what you want to represent as you go to more than adding and subtracting,335.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,2.667,2.333,1.667,335.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
numbers of Economics I would say like for example so,340.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,2.667,2.0,1.667,340.0,3.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
scary Simon lot of convention Accords just she,345.0,3.333,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.333,1.333,345.0,3.667,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
that the country's somehow bound to respect even if a lot of countries,350.0,3.333,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.333,350.0,3.667,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
are not respecting those and I would think that it's,355.0,3.333,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.333,355.0,3.333,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
a bit difficult to not being you mean humanitarian considering,360.0,3.333,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.333,360.0,3.333,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
Yemen position themselves to be our position because like for example people,365.0,3.333,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.333,365.0,3.333,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
in Yemen didn't choose to start in Yemen with their life right and so if,370.0,3.333,3.667,1.667,2.0,2.0,1.333,370.0,3.333,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
they would start to Korea they would have the Korean mushroom tea and everything that comes with it,375.0,3.333,3.667,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.333,375.0,3.0,2.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
so it's kind of Epic buyers to sing by on the numbers and the last,380.0,3.333,3.667,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.333,380.0,3.333,2.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
part is about comparing refugees for example even if Korea is not Dutch learn,385.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.333,385.0,3.333,2.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
and even if there's a lot of problem we're basically comparing something,390.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.333,390.0,3.333,2.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
that is not comparable I would say because it's for attention,395.0,3.0,4.0,2.333,1.667,2.0,1.333,395.0,3.0,2.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
is somewhere near 1 million people in people will get gems around for,400.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.667,2.0,1.333,400.0,3.0,2.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
maybe 500 people so I would say in the last spoke about,405.0,2.667,4.0,2.0,1.667,2.0,1.333,405.0,3.333,2.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
terrorism I guess it's a bit I'm a bit biased because I'm from Europe,410.0,3.333,4.0,2.0,1.667,2.0,1.333,410.0,3.333,2.667,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
but I would say that despite everything we can hear you,415.0,3.0,3.667,2.0,1.667,2.0,1.333,415.0,3.333,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
let me see not TRUE 382 diversion so,420.0,3.0,3.667,2.0,1.667,2.0,1.333,420.0,3.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
people are not really feeling scared like they're not really feeling concerned the whole therapy,425.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.667,2.333,1.333,425.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
thing and yeah they are concerned but the link between immigration and terrorism he's a bit,430.0,3.333,3.0,2.0,1.667,2.333,1.333,430.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
more difficult than for example in France most of the people that went on there,435.0,2.667,4.0,2.0,1.667,2.0,1.333,435.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
are parks was actually French people it's French national tea,440.0,2.667,4.0,2.0,1.667,2.0,1.333,440.0,3.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
people so it's not the Yellowjackets I guess but then before that there were Terror,445.0,2.667,4.0,2.0,1.667,2.0,1.333,445.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.333,1.333,1.0
isn't helped by jihadists sharing some sort of like,450.0,2.333,4.0,2.0,1.667,2.0,1.333,450.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
super extreme Islam yeah Belinda in the u.s. you mean or,455.0,3.0,3.667,1.667,2.0,2.0,1.333,455.0,3.333,2.333,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
internally then they are all the terrorist act we had except,460.0,3.0,3.667,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.333,460.0,3.333,2.333,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
one or two were done by people that aren't French or Belgian nationality,465.0,3.0,3.667,1.667,2.0,2.0,1.333,465.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
okay that's the same that not a lot of people know,470.0,3.0,3.667,1.667,2.0,2.0,1.333,470.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
which is like there's,475.0,3.0,3.667,1.667,2.0,2.0,1.333,475.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.333,2.0,1.0
a un from acts that several countries that you don't take in refugees,480.0,3.0,3.667,1.667,2.0,2.0,1.333,480.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.333,2.0,1.0
first of all the thing is strictly speaking this is not influencing yeah you enact,485.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.667,2.0,1.333,485.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.333,2.0,1.0
is I can so agreement between countries that it's going to be cool if you do this but then you don't really have,490.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,2.333,2.0,1.333,490.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.333,2.0,1.0
to so it's an on enforcing act therefore there's no,495.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,2.333,2.0,1.333,495.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
Global there it doesn't it's not a global agreement between all these countries therefore,500.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,2.333,2.0,1.333,500.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.333,2.333,1.0
we're not going to look at that it doesn't it's not a global agreement between all these countries therefore we're not going to receive any laundry doing so good,505.0,3.667,3.0,1.667,2.333,2.333,1.333,505.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.333,2.333,1.0
okay and then the other thing is Korea is,510.0,3.667,3.0,1.667,2.333,2.0,1.333,510.0,3.333,3.667,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
already taking in an annual number of refugees from North Korea so although,515.0,3.667,3.667,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.333,515.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
it's not comparable to the money Bushland but the thing is if you put on a ratio,520.0,3.333,3.333,1.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,520.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
of how many people are in the country and how many refugees are picking and it's actually comparable and then,525.0,3.333,3.667,1.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,525.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
since we're taking already taking in that much refugees each year adding 500 more may,530.0,3.333,3.333,1.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,530.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0
look like not more but then considering that our unemployment rate has it's,535.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,535.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0
already a percent and they were taking in the early hands plant love refugees,540.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,540.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0
500 is enough to tip the citizens,545.0,2.667,3.667,1.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,545.0,3.0,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.333
and to conclude I would say that to kind of state of,550.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,550.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.333
if refugees are good or bad we should look at which country is the most,555.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,555.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.667,1.333
culturally and economically powerful even if in some point could be say,560.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,560.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.667,1.333
that you're trying to access to u.s. u.s. is really well known to be,565.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,565.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.667,1.333
countries of immigrants I would say that if they are Miniature deliberately more,570.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,570.0,3.667,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.333
power than if managed correctly yes,575.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,575.0,3.667,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.333
it is over,580.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,580.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.667,1.333
so I'm out of breath from the article reassigned it 0.15 the,5.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
21 convention direct with Russia act which basically stated that Korea will except for Fisheries,10.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,10.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
unlike many of the other Asian countries that did not sign it and I think it's very important,15.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,15.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
to create keeps up with this promise and that is becoming more,20.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,20.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
and more International laws and there's a reason why I said they would exhibitions,25.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,25.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
in which case I think signifies that we are ready for it first of all both financially,30.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,30.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
and culturally and to suddenly turn our backs on these refugees for in Desperate,35.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,35.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.333
situations when they're coming into our country to flee their Civil War,40.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,40.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.333
is very hypocritical and against the words that Korea should be keeping it with International,45.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,45.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.333
Community and I think it's very important to emphasize that the number of bring you many refugees,50.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,50.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
are coming in is when you about founder 15 which is very small compared to other,55.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,55.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
countries which mentioned like Germany which I understand is in a different situation but even so it is still very small,60.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,60.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
compared to a lot of other countries for accepting many were refugees from many diverse backgrounds,65.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,65.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
it looked also mention that they restricted to Jeju Island which is already,70.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,70.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
known for its many Chinese and other country of immigrants so it's not,75.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,75.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
as if there's only invading the mainland and it's very easy for us to contain them,80.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,80.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
and try to contain situation if people very much worried about crime or any,85.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,85.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
other problems that arise with immigration so I think,90.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,90.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
for Koreans to suddenly say all this not accepting refugees just because we are all One National,95.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,95.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
what now look to the nation is very critical,100.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,100.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
and also a rash decision that shouldn't be made so quickly,105.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,105.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
well although I do agree that some humanitarian effort,110.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,110.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
is needed for the Civil War I think your points exemplify exactly why Korea isn't,115.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0,115.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
actually ready for such an intake in Immigration you mentioned that he,120.0,3.667,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0,120.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
only lived in a very small number of people I think it's around 500 and even with that small,125.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,125.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
number of refugees that we took in people have signed a petition,130.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,130.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
they've protests on the streets many people are displeased that doesn't feel like and it's neat,135.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,135.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
like a small number of 500 people and also Korea is a very young nation and,140.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,140.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,2.333,1.0
as you know that we were put into the industrial revolution,145.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,145.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.333,2.0,1.667
very quickly so I think culturally and socially we aren't actually,150.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,150.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.333,2.0,1.667
quite ready to be such a,155.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,155.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
big police factor in the glow on the global scale for integration,160.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,160.0,3.0,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
and I think the statistics show this so,165.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,165.0,3.0,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
as you can actually read from the article as well most of the opposing side,170.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,170.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
actually come from the younger generation of Korea even despite the more liberal,175.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,175.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
despite them being the more liberal portion of the population and I think that shows,180.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,180.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
are culturally and socially Korea isn't ready for internationalism,185.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,185.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
there's also the political background of Korea and the roots of xenophobia and homogeneity in Korea where,190.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,190.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
we sort of stick to ourselves and we don't really care for other people they're non-korean so,195.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,195.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
I think in that regard we're not ready in the social and cultural mask,200.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,200.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
well you,205.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,205.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
said they were not really culturally socially first of all social you mentioned how,210.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,210.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
Korea has it's a big eyes development very quickly I would say after Korean War however if,215.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,215.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
you look at Germany for example they also have to war to begin development really quickly it wasn't,220.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,220.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
until even the 80s when the Western and Eastern combined so I'm not sure if that could be technically argued,225.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,225.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
in this case it culturally yes you're right it's a lot of people not really okay,230.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,230.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
with the idea of a lot of other cultures coming in especially as you've mentioned and regeneration but if there,235.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,235.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
was one article that argue that the rather than necessarily xenophobic racist,240.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,240.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
just those factors it could be also due to the fact that a lot of them generation are nervous,245.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,245.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
about the current situation you cannot be situation in Korea what they call yo U as in that,250.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,250.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
they believe that these immigrants will be character jobs will take a lot of welfare,255.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,255.0,3.667,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
that technically belong to the younger generation however what I like to argue is,260.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,260.0,3.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
people are usually looking for Laura and jobs which in my opinion is actually complete opposite,265.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,265.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
of what the Millennials or the younger generation are looking for because someone people who graduate from college they're looking for usually,270.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,270.0,3.667,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
high in jobs that pay well that will get them ready for the society for marriage for example,275.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,275.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
and I feel anyone to actually filling the void in which the younger generation are very reluctant to take,280.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,280.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
so I believe that this will actually serve as a good opportunity for them and in order,285.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,285.0,3.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
if we educate the people on on the effects and also the not effects,290.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,290.0,3.667,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
that will rise for migration I think it's important to note that,295.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,295.0,3.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
the people will be might be more likely to support this system,300.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,300.0,3.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
to emphasize that it's not going to create damage but impact and if it does it is possible to,305.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,305.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
be 4 to positive then Warden - I do agree that immigrants,310.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,310.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
do tend to take on lower-end drops then the natives however I think that again shows,315.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,315.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
how not ready we are as a country to let in these refugees,320.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,320.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
despite the fact despite the fact that on the global scale we already have,325.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,325.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
evidence of immigrants taking the raindrops just to get America Europe for this thing what is,330.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,330.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
it you tend to take jobs that the native Stone want and I'm pretty sure,335.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,335.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
a lot of them generation also knows this fact and even then we're still against it,340.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,340.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
and I think the fact that the younger generation is focusing on their own I guess survival,345.0,3.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,345.0,3.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,2.333,1.333
than the lives of these people these poor people,350.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,350.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
who are escaping Civil War just goes to show that currently the imagination isn't interested in,355.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,355.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
monitoring efforts and I think we should also be very careful,360.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,360.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
of the political we know that this issue might,365.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,365.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
cause as you can see in America and in Europe the political scene has become,370.0,3.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,370.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
very extreme and polarized because of issues such as these and,375.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,375.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
I can't see any way to avoid like,380.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,380.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
a trend towards a political extremism in terms of this issue that,385.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,385.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
as you can see from other countries,390.0,3.333,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,390.0,2.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
even,395.0,4.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,395.0,2.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
people with extremism which is a very valid argument I agree America especially has been facing this,400.0,3.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,400.0,2.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
problem and Europe with the recent Syrian refugee crisis has been going through this a lot but I think,405.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,405.0,2.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.333
it's also important to mention that I think it is also part of government,410.0,3.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,410.0,2.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.333
kind of responsibility to keep the monastery and it's not,415.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,415.0,2.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.333
opposed to in part judgment on things well so it's important for to keep,420.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,420.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.333
morale and I like not lights,425.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,425.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.333
up great I think in the country and I think it's also important to remember,430.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,430.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.333
for Koreans that we ourselves were officials ones just 56 years ago we were,435.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,435.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
in Shanghai forming our own government or instruction he's and understand as politically,440.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,440.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
very sensitive issue but I think that shouldn't discourage us from,445.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,445.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
doing the right thing in my opinion and trying to bring the people,450.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,450.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
around other than just appeal to them briefly for just for political sake first,455.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,455.0,3.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
of all I think what's important is corrupting them on on wrong information factually wrong,460.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,460.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
information such as the recent hashtag with the gesture women right Swedish woman,465.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,465.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
which stated that six people were killed which was very baseless there was no no evidence against it so,470.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,470.0,3.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
I think a lot of these are backed by stereotypes and wrong information so correcting that I think will fix some of the issues,475.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,475.0,3.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
that you've stated you did you mentioned on government's role,480.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,480.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
in I guess correcting this issue but at the same time I think what might be even,485.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,485.0,3.667,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
more important than the cultural and social aspect of this issue is the policy behind the current,490.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,490.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
system that lets in these refugees so if the articles,495.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,495.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
that we read are accurate it does seem that this current system is very inefficient and does have major flaws,500.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,500.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
on the fact that these are histories are allowed to have it for long probation,505.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,505.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
period before this and be able to live in Korea,510.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,510.0,3.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
during that long period of time is I guess a whirring factor for many of the people who,515.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,515.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,2.333,1.0
are worried about safety and other issues that could arise from immigration and at the same time the,520.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,520.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
current acceptance rate that we have in our acquaintance very low it's only around 2%,525.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,525.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
and compared to other countries that has pretty as a pretty low,530.0,3.667,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,530.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
percentage so I think even the government is sort of worried about the backlash that it can,535.0,3.667,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,535.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
face if it accepts more than a certain percentage of refugees so I think,540.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,540.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
I do agree that the government is trying to resolve the I guess,545.0,3.667,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,545.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
negative sentiments horse issue but I think that's more of a preservation tactic of the government's to try to,550.0,3.667,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,550.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
appease the population more than a mature decision,555.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,555.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
towards stronger policy for,560.0,3.667,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,560.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
so on the matter on the matter of taking refugees from Yemen to Jeju Island on the,5.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
most primary concern is the other one about the economy quite clearly the query,10.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,10.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
creates the economy right now isn't really stable although at the very top,15.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,15.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
of the very wealthy have the variables we have a lot of money but the,20.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,20.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
bottom there are there are a lot of people who doesn't have enough money and they struggle to live out their everyday,25.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,25.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
lives in this in this in this in this chaotic time period in,30.0,2.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,30.0,2.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
am accepting Yemen universities may actually further,35.0,2.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,35.0,2.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
kiosk the our government taxes are limited,40.0,2.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,40.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
and if we have to give the refugees government's print out of our own taxes,45.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,45.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
then that much that much money has to be taken from,50.0,2.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,50.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
somewhere else and I think that that money can be,55.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,55.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
used that money should be first least for our own people first,60.0,2.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,60.0,2.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
if you are a nice if our country was a stable,65.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,65.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
country and if we had a lot of money that we can spend when,70.0,3.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,70.0,2.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
sure we should accept refugees but our state our situation isn't very good right now so I think,75.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,75.0,2.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
that we need to say we need to stabilize our economy first and then letting the refugees later,80.0,2.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,80.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
when when when it's acceptable to do so,85.0,2.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,85.0,2.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
okay well first of all,90.0,2.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,90.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
I'm not really sure what you mean by we have an unstable economy,95.0,2.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,95.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
over the chaotic State compared to many other,100.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,100.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
countries I do believe Korea is very,105.0,1.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,105.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
stable economy and if you just look at the GDP,110.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,110.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
people over love and beside I don't think this should be the or problem the core,115.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,115.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
of the problem is that there is a crisis happening and,120.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,120.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0
we should prioritize human life over any like political or cultural,125.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,125.0,2.667,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0
conflicts and you know,130.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,130.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0
you say we wait until,135.0,2.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,135.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0
our economy is stabilized with there's less chaos but the crisis isn't going to wait for us,140.0,2.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,140.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0
War isn't going to wait for people to be ready,145.0,2.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,145.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0
to take refugees I think we should really have to see what what what,150.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,150.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0
what is the on a human level or is the priority,155.0,2.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,155.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
oh,160.0,2.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,160.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
yeah that's my favorite,165.0,2.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,165.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
he said I have to prioritize over human life but in,170.0,2.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,170.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
any said our economy isn't it's a very good economy the GDP is,175.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,175.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
high countries other countries but you have to take into account that the GP,180.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,180.0,2.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
is the average amount of income there are because,185.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,185.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
there are people at the very bottom of the society chain that struggle to live,190.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,190.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
out their lives and I'll show you I'm not we shouldn't,195.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,195.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
prioritize what human life but I'm wondering if whether that priority should extend,200.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,200.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
to foreigners first I think that all of there are other,205.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,205.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
countries there are other countries who are able to accept the refugees and,210.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,210.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
their are Koreans who are struggling so we should,215.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,215.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
take care of them first,220.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,220.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
well the thing about the whole texting is that,225.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,225.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
you speak as if we are sacrificing our citizens,230.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,230.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
like money that was already reserved for citizens to,235.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,235.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
the yemeni people but that's just not the case it's,240.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,240.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
as if it's not as if there was money allocated for the pole to pole in Korean,245.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,245.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
and that has been shifted towards the yemeni people I'm,250.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,250.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
sure with enough intent the government would be flexible enough to allocate,255.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,255.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
enough money for both problems may be called from something that,260.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,260.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
is not really,265.0,2.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,265.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
it's not be so direct to people's lives,270.0,2.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,270.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
for example you know with any government,275.0,1.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,275.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
any government that's that's involved in some kind of,280.0,1.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0,280.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
international conflict especially especially Innovative,285.0,1.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0,285.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
Korean warm move to the taxes actually go to the military,290.0,1.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0,290.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
and the proportions are amazing how,295.0,1.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,295.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
how much actually goes into the tree and how little goes into public service,300.0,1.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,300.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0
and I just don't think that that's the first thing that we should focus on it's,305.0,1.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,305.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0
not a weighing scale between all the cool people Korean,310.0,1.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,310.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
and the yemeni people,315.0,1.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,315.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
you talked about the,320.0,1.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,320.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
money you talk about life we can reject the money that goes into the military and we start,325.0,1.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,325.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
to take care of the yemeni citizen strength but,330.0,2.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,330.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
that's quite it's not asking for that we all,335.0,2.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,335.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
those amazing peaceful we are in a crisis of world and I was going to Korea and there,340.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,340.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
are political factions including the tug of Americans that encourages,345.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,345.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
and force us to and extraneous amount of money towards the military,350.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,350.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
for their own safety and for our own safety as well so,355.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,355.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
sure it's a good idea is if he just if,360.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,360.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
he stopped the war and reject money III read that money to the yemeni citizens,365.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,365.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
but if that doesn't but that's not that's quite realistically,370.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,370.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
man there are forces that we have to contend with and,375.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,375.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
they may not allow us to make that decision so easily,380.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,380.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
so what I'm seeing is that like taking Indian citizens is great,385.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,385.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
but only if the situation with situation allows self I mean I think that,390.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,390.0,2.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
our society can take care of that right now,395.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,395.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
I,400.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,400.0,2.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
mean,405.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,405.0,2.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
I guess we can go about,410.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,410.0,2.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
the whole allocation of money thinking much more detailed my,415.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,415.0,2.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
main point is that,420.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,420.0,2.333,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
the first thing that we think you know taken away so to speak the from,425.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,425.0,2.333,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
the tax money shouldn't be Department of Public Service,430.0,2.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,430.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
it's not as if,435.0,2.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,435.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
this is a my point still stands that it's not as the money,440.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,440.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
going into the amnesty of these yemeni people is,445.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,445.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
is directed straight from the public service cut,450.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,450.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
I,455.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,455.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
really do not know what the topic is,460.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,460.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
but I would still,465.0,1.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,465.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
like to say like sick,470.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,470.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
at least at least we should really focus on,475.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,475.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
if there are other countries that is,480.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,480.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
your daily people could realistically go to Ocean First consider the wires it is happening,485.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,485.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
already and the second point is,490.0,1.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,490.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
I think people are focusing way too much on what to have these people inside,495.0,2.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,495.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
the country or not rather than you know how to solve this crisis not know how to solve this question about what you know what we can,500.0,3.0,4.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,500.0,3.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
do to help this crisis and we had to we should really think about what if people,505.0,1.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,505.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
I,510.0,1.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,510.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
didn't catch,515.0,1.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,515.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
the last part though I'm just,520.0,1.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,520.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
putting aside the matter for me to take on over here,525.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,525.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
sure there are there are purities,530.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,530.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
who came to create to the best of my knowledge there are people who,535.0,1.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,535.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
is giving me a minute to my Legion for nine days and after that I engage our they came to Korea,540.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,540.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
because they couldn't stay in Malaysia anymore so I'll sure those refugees,545.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,545.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
may be in a dire need for a place to live but there are more people,550.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,550.0,2.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
that food since it came to Korea or because it,555.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.333,555.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
because in their communities it has a very difficult very very conditions,560.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.333,560.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
okay so I think one of the major cons of,5.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
letting the enemies of Jesus Korea is this idea of Koreans come first so if,10.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,10.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
you look at the statistics the majority of the people who are against the Emmys,15.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,15.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0
refugees were actually people in their twenties and thirties and middle-income individuals,20.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,20.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0
in the middle income class and,25.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,25.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
this is although this this is although this is a hypothesis this may stem from the fact that there's a,30.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,30.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
high levels of youth unemployment so there is this concept of this idea that,35.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.333,35.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
why are we letting these refugees come in and why are we spending taxpayers,40.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,40.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
money on them when we should be focusing on other important issues that are more relevant to,45.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,45.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
current people such as this idea of youth unemployment yeah,50.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,50.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
and also the second point is that because of the mass in flux,55.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,55.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
so in 2015 there said there were no in no refugees but number drastically,60.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,60.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
increased so it also seems like they could potentially be taking advantage of the system,65.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,65.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
or Korean Korean law,70.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,70.0,2.667,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0
so yeah I heard your points,75.0,2.333,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,75.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
for Mike those I'll start with my point of view first,80.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,80.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
off these people giving these who came to this country came here basically,85.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,85.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
to seek shelter from the war right the many wars I've been going on these people,90.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,90.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
ran away from it they don't want to participate in the war and they were basically,95.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,95.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
you know stripping from their rights to be safe and be educated,100.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,100.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
and those kind of stuff and that's why they came to this country and not allowing them to,105.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,105.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
stay in this country even though we actually made it into law that we could take them,110.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,110.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
in b.o.b.,115.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,115.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.333
it be what it called you know if he trying,120.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,120.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.333
to you know say that you're a nice person but only that be a facade right,125.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,125.0,3.333,2.333,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.333
you're actually a bad person but not lying not for not allowing them to be in here and,130.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,130.0,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0
that was one of the basic human rights issues and the second point would be,135.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,135.0,3.667,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.0
Koreans are not letting them because they think they are racist and rapists and,140.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,140.0,3.667,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.0
terrorists right but those things are not TRUE since,145.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,145.0,3.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0
they ran away from that were they are the people who don't do not like violence,150.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,150.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
so that's one of the main points that you could say that they don't do it like that,155.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,155.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
okay so it's our your first point was that you can you tell me your first one again,160.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,160.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
so people get it's a basic human rights,165.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,165.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
issue Koreans made a law that would allow them to come,170.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,170.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
into the country to seek shelter although since they made the,175.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,175.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
system right it they are basically allowing it but once it happens,180.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,180.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.333
they're not allowing allowing it so it's basically going against what they originally,185.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,185.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0
set their phones so you're saying you don't want to be like controversial,190.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,190.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0
yeah basically what you're trying to say well I think,195.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,195.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0
the ideal is good the idea of letting refugees in Turkey a country is good but,200.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,200.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0
for the case of the yemenis refugees seeing this Mass influx especially,205.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,205.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0
in Korea which is a much other countries with much more limited resources that countries,210.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,210.0,4.0,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
in like Europe or America could possibly be seen as threatening to the community,215.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,215.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
people especially because it's only the island of JeJu and judge it was a very small part of Korea,220.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,220.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
with a much more limited population so yeah,225.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,225.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
yeah and I guess I guess that's kind of TRUE but you know the other point is,230.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,230.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
that those yemenis are only 500 people right over the course of,235.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,235.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
these years thousand North Koreans came to this country and you know if you think about,240.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,240.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
that North Koreans are currently we're at War stating their,245.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,245.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
these bad people you know according to like the 50s and,250.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,250.0,3.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0
60s people they are these bad people with the other Notions and there they could they,255.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,255.0,4.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0
have the highest possibility of being spies right so in that kind of view yemenis,260.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,260.0,4.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0
they're only here to seek shelter they're not here to terrorize or anything like that it can't cats eat for see anything like that but North Koreans coming,265.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,265.0,4.333,3.333,1.667,1.333,1.0,1.0
to this country for seeking shelter could be a bigger issue than that then why are we allowing North Koreans,270.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,270.0,4.333,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.333
to come here but not the yemenis well,275.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,275.0,4.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.333
that is a good point on a human rights level the,280.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,280.0,4.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0
I think they could be viewed in the same way but from a Korean,285.0,3.667,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,285.0,4.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0
citizens perspective North Korea is still,290.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,290.0,4.0,3.0,1.667,1.333,1.0,1.0
part of current it can still be viewed as an extension of Korea that was just simply divided because the war,295.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,295.0,4.0,3.0,1.667,1.333,1.0,1.0
and especially because it was only a career isn't was only divided like 50 or 60,300.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,300.0,4.0,3.0,1.667,1.667,1.0,1.0
70 years ago we share the same language we have a very similar culture,305.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,305.0,4.0,3.333,2.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
but for the yemenis I think it's possible that Korean citizens can view them as Outsiders,310.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,310.0,4.333,3.667,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
and I think we should recognize the like,315.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,315.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Korea is a country for Koreans and we should respect the Korean citizens,320.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,320.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
perspective of like like this nationalism,325.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,325.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
yes I guess yeah that's one of them is good and no Koreans first cuz we are here,330.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,330.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
is actually a good point well I'm not against it but um,335.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,335.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
these days you know all over the world we're talking about globalism,340.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,340.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
and like we're talking about how other races are living in other countries,345.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,345.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
we already know that being a racist in America is a big issue and,350.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,350.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
like it's just between whites and blacks and those were all occurring issues,355.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,355.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
for the last century right and everyone in the world,360.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,360.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
right now like I guess kind of agrees that being a racist is bad but isn't,365.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,365.0,3.667,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0
that basically what we're trying to were really doing here in Korea being a racist rejecting,370.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,370.0,3.667,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0
the other culture without knowing anything about them calling them terrorists rapists,375.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,375.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
and stuff like that I lived in Saudi Arabia for two years and come on that's one of the biggest,380.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,380.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
countries for you know as long as people and over there those people,385.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,385.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
were really nice and I've loved like I didn't get to know their culture or anything like that but if you don't,390.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,390.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
and they're really nice and,395.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,395.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
you know you have before before the religion like everyone like I bet everybody,400.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,400.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
like has this kind of compassionate Easy Motion everyone can relate to these emotions,405.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,405.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
and those are the basic you know human stuff I guess and,410.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,410.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
if you get to know those stuff then would have people be more likely,415.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,415.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.0,1.0
to like connect to be 70s and or be more compassionate towards them so yeah it's,420.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,420.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.0,1.0
like judging a book by it's cover I guess I definitely,425.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,425.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.0,1.0
do agree that that we shouldn't reject them as refugees because of,430.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,430.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.0,1.0
this racist image but I think going Beyond racism it's more about national,435.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,435.0,3.667,3.333,1.333,1.333,1.0,1.0
interests so each person in the world is part of a country there are citizens,440.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,440.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.0,1.0
of a country and that that country has its own government and the government is supposed to work in,445.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,445.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.0,1.0
the interest of his people and I don't think it's a bad thing that,450.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,450.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.0,1.0
Korea should try to focus more on the citizens I definitely,455.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,455.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.0,1.0
think that we idealistically we should let these people in,460.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,460.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.0,1.0
and from the view of from Human Rights Viewpoint is that it definitely is good but,465.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,465.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
from the perspective of the Korean citizen in might be a better idea I can,470.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,470.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
definitely understand why people would prefer to spend more tax money on,475.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,475.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
improving more imminent problems with using the Korea Society,480.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,480.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
so we're imminent problems you say,485.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,485.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
and you said that like the youth unemployment problem is pretty big and like,490.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,490.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
I agree and like youth problems their unemployment they're big but the current issue,495.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,495.0,3.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
is I mean he's our hearing Jeju Island and if you don't,500.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,500.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
do anything it's just going to escalate from that point right so I guess,505.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,505.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
like some like speaking and,510.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,510.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
interests of the Jesuit I guess the Jeju Islands was basically developed,515.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,515.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
by the government to become a become a tourist like right,520.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,520.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
these yemeni people in these people are coming to you such as your ally without any money without,525.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,525.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.333
anything to pay and they're even getting Financial Financial benefits from the national,530.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,530.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
from Korea that's why I guess you're driving people are against it if you think about the Chinese people,535.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,535.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.333
to digital and there's like tons of people coming to Jeju Island right but they're spending,540.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,540.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.333
money there that's why they're not you know they're not against these Chinese,545.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,545.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.333
people coming in here right so I guess we're just thinking about money too much,550.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,550.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.333
we could later on like expanded you know if we take care of but these Japanese,555.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,555.0,3.333,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.333
in my opinion regarding recording the Jeju Island,5.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.667,2.667,1.0,5.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Refugee crisis I I argued that South Korea should,10.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.667,2.333,1.0,10.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
help South Korea should I said except these refugees and,15.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.667,2.333,1.0,15.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
provide them for humanitarian support as they are great in 1991 convention regarding,20.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.667,2.667,1.0,20.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
the status of refugees and I will I will provide 33,25.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.667,2.0,1.0,25.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
reason for the first of first and foremost South Korea has signed the 1991 conventions on the status,30.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.667,2.0,1.0,30.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
of refugees and therefore South Korea should be able to should fully applies to,35.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.667,2.0,1.0,35.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
to to act as accordingly to this Refugee,40.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.667,1.0,40.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
convention this is this is especially important since South Korea,45.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,45.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0

very small number of 500 refugees and,55.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.667,1.0,55.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
refugees also and South Korea has been locked in sand the political,60.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,60.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
decisions of politicians to change their stance if there is not it's not,65.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,65.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
following the convention also the yemeni Christ also the yemenis crisis,70.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,70.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
should not be ignored by the International Community and in the sense of many South Koreans who think,75.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,75.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
that you can be ignored refugees only not accepting Berkeley engineering,80.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,2.0,2.333,1.0,80.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
you jeez I know what,85.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,2.0,3.333,1.0,85.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
should not be,90.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,2.0,2.667,1.0,90.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
angered by the international community's no we're not were not accepting refugees,95.0,4.0,2.667,1.0,2.0,3.333,1.0,95.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
only a short title answer to sell that terrified only satisfies the,100.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.667,2.0,1.0,100.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
fear-mongering population yet South Korea should get,105.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.667,2.667,1.0,105.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
should,110.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.333,1.0,110.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
disagree with your assertions first of all he said that,115.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.333,1.0,115.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
South Korea is fully capable of accepting yemenis refugees I would like to,120.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,2.0,2.333,1.0,120.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
disagree on that point because the nation has seen a dramatic,125.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,125.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
hike in the eighth in the number of refugees from 42 seeking Asylum,130.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,2.0,2.333,1.0,130.0,3.667,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0
last year to 519 seeking Asylum this year would the numbers of almost,135.0,2.0,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0,135.0,3.333,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0
increased by 10 volt LED more than tenfold and,140.0,2.0,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,140.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
Nation probably did not prepared for this dramatic increase and,145.0,2.0,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0,145.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
also Korea is known for its homogeneous society majority,150.0,3.333,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,150.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
of Korean citizens don't expect that,155.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,155.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
much racial diversity in their society and they have not received enough education,160.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,160.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
to accept people of different ethnic diversity,165.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,165.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
and I believe that such educational and in terms of,170.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,170.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
government subsidy wise such funding should be acquired first before accepting,175.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,175.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
that many refugees because there are potential for racial discrimination and there's,180.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,180.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.0
also potential for the government not being able to take care of the refugees they accepted because,185.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,185.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
of their because they did not prepare for that many refugees entering,190.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,190.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.0
the country and in addition to my,195.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,195.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
position I would like to assert that I would like to bring out the question of the,200.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,200.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
security of locals when we accepted at least to the Jeju Island or there enough,205.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,205.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
policies in hand to secure the,210.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,210.0,3.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
security security of locals and with respect to refugees coming,215.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,215.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.667,1.0
in so I would like to,220.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,220.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.0
I would like to say something against what she have just argued primarily,225.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,225.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.333
primarily she had what she has argued that South Korea,230.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,230.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.333
isn't all work isn't ready to accept these refugees however in considering an economic,235.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,235.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.333
standpoint and considering how the nation is stable South Korea in turn in terms of these already,240.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,240.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.667,1.333
has much more capable of accepting refugees than four examples some Nations who have already,245.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,245.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.333
I've talked to many refugees so and and humanitarian statement they at least,250.0,4.333,3.333,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0,250.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
have a place to eat and to work which many of these refugees has not had the opportunity also,255.0,4.0,3.333,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0,255.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
shares argued that South Korea is to hormones homogeneous and many people face,260.0,3.667,3.333,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0,260.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
discrimination upon arriving South Korea however this power there,265.0,4.333,3.333,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0,265.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
are if there is already a substantial amount of foreign foreign people and especially people,270.0,4.333,3.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,270.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
with Muslim backgrounds living in South South Korea and and therefore this,275.0,4.0,3.333,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0,275.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
and there and this amount is much more than the 500 yemeni refugees and,280.0,4.0,3.333,1.0,1.667,2.0,1.0,280.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
also she has argued that they should be accepted after South Korea's ready for,285.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.667,2.0,1.0,285.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
accepting refugees however that this means that the 500 yemenis,290.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0,290.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
refugees or maybe a huge portion of them like what happened now has,295.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0,295.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
has to or we have to only have a temporary status or where either be returned to Yemen,300.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0,300.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
how this however they have already paid the potential amount and paid a huge,305.0,4.0,3.333,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0,305.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
risk for for arriving to South Korea and putting them back,310.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0,310.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
is against humanitarian obligations at South Korea has a week to follow,315.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0,315.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
as a developed country,320.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0,320.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
I like to disagree on how he said that Korea,325.0,4.0,3.333,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0,325.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
is economically and economically and just stable in general,330.0,4.0,3.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,330.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
which you stated Korea is that state of war the war between South Korea and,335.0,4.0,3.333,1.0,1.667,2.0,1.0,335.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
North Korea has not ended since since 1945 the,340.0,4.0,3.333,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0,340.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
which the war started after World War 2 so which is around that time all,345.0,4.0,3.333,1.0,2.0,1.667,1.0,345.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
the men in Korea go to a military our Force our are required,350.0,4.0,3.333,1.0,2.0,1.667,1.0,350.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
to go to military because of the situation I believe that the situation is hardly stable,355.0,4.0,3.333,1.0,2.0,1.667,1.0,355.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
and also you said that because there are many people of Muslim background in Korea,360.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.333,1.0,360.0,4.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
people in Korea are prepared to accept refugees well I would like to say I,365.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,365.0,4.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
disagree that with you because although there are many people,370.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,370.0,4.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
of foreign background in Korea I believe that they have not integrated well into the society,375.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,375.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
well just seeing the Christ Community of the separation between the international population,380.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,380.0,4.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
and the Korean population I believe that further education and some campaigning,385.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,385.0,3.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
is needed to prepare the Korean citizens to accept,390.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0,390.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
those refugees and except on racially different people into their society,395.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0,395.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
and in terms of humanitarian Aid I believe that I agree with,400.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0,400.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
you that if the Korea has the necessary means they should provide,405.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0,405.0,3.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
humanitarian Aid however,410.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,410.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
because of the situations that I said beforehand I believe that Korea is not prepared,415.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,415.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
to accept that many refugees and if the nation cannot provide for those refugees they cannot,420.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,420.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
they should not try to accept as refugees if they cannot care for them that well,425.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0,425.0,3.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
so I would like,430.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0,430.0,3.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
to add some points to what she has are good to begin with she has,435.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,435.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
argued that South Korea is in the very economic very is a very interested,440.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,440.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
in stable Nation considering the war between North Korea and South Korea Korea is in,445.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0,445.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
a state of war in Korea it and Korean men are upload jacket military and,450.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,450.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
of course Northeast Asia as a German South Korea North Korea General is very in stable place in the political,455.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,455.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
view however South Korea still has signed signed the 1991,460.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,460.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0

are usually South Korea has only hastening sign scientists in order to,470.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,470.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
gain some in order to gain some status as a developed country,475.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,475.0,3.667,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
towards the fact that South Korea is capable of accepting a substantial amount to procure,480.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,480.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
geez and I would like to further I would like to further,485.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,485.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
clarify my remaining art when South Korea should not should not be focused,490.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,490.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
on their own intent on internal struggle even though their heart South Korea is a nation,495.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,495.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
that is a nation that that focuses on,500.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0,500.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0

South Korea should be a nation that tries to resolve International conflict and tries to,510.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,510.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0

and the gospel others but I think it's more important to look after our,30.0,2.333,3.0,2.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,30.0,3.0,3.333,2.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
people first so if we look at an example of since breathtaking refugees is kind of a big,35.0,2.333,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,35.0,2.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
boundary if we look this into small boundary I think we can compare it with,40.0,2.333,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,40.0,3.0,3.333,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
a family so let's say the young family was ten,45.0,2.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,45.0,3.0,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
children and I'm not that wealthy and some of the children are getting enough food and,50.0,2.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,50.0,3.0,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
some aren't some are getting a good education but some are we the education at have,55.0,2.333,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,55.0,3.0,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
a bad environment for upbringing but just because,60.0,2.333,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,60.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
other wealthy families are taking adopting children,65.0,1.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,65.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
adopting is a great thing to do on these things have children and it's great,70.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,70.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
but would it be good to take in children,75.0,1.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,75.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
adopt children when you can't even take care of your own children properly,80.0,1.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,80.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
so I think it's best thing is to take care of our children,85.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,85.0,2.333,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
Fist and then look off balance so that's my first point and,90.0,1.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,90.0,2.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
my second point is that the people are mainly,95.0,1.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,95.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
Muslim and it's not to do with race I'm not being,100.0,1.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,100.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
I'm not being racist in the fact that,105.0,2.333,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,105.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
I think it's to do with the cultural thing,110.0,2.333,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,110.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
and,115.0,2.333,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,115.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
okay so if I'm I'm for immigration I guess so,120.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,120.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
let me just address your first point about taking care of Korean Nationals first,125.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,125.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
so yeah Korea should take care of their Nationals as well,130.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,130.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
but just because you know having refugees,135.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,135.0,3.667,3.333,2.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
who are applying for jobs that it could go to Koreans doesn't necessarily mean that they're not taking,140.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,140.0,3.667,3.667,2.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
care of Koreans in a way because what if those what if Koreans don't want those jobs,145.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,145.0,3.667,3.667,2.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
than all those small menial jobs would just then go to refugees and in a way it would help Korean,150.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,150.0,3.667,3.667,2.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
society and just because creating some creating Nationals are poor that's not the fault,155.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,155.0,3.667,3.667,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
of the government maybe it's the fault of the of the person of,160.0,2.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,160.0,3.667,3.333,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
the LOL it's maybe their own motivation that they lost so that they can't find a job they can't take,165.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,165.0,3.333,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
care of themselves and also for a second point,170.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.333,1.667,1.0,170.0,3.333,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
I think I have an idea of where you were going and to be honest Muslims,175.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.333,1.667,1.0,175.0,3.333,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
are actually considered one of the religions that is very well respected and,180.0,3.0,3.667,1.667,1.667,1.667,1.0,180.0,3.333,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
culturally they keep a lot of ground rules but those people extremists,185.0,2.0,3.667,1.667,1.667,1.667,1.0,185.0,3.333,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
are the ones who don't stick to those rules and want to add more rules of their own,190.0,2.667,3.667,1.667,1.667,1.667,1.0,190.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
to that religion so it's not necessarily religious wise,195.0,2.667,3.667,1.667,1.667,1.667,1.0,195.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
and I think that,200.0,2.667,3.667,1.667,1.667,1.667,1.0,200.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
Korea as a homogeneous society should actually become a little bit more heterogeneous and more,205.0,2.333,3.333,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,205.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
of a cultural Melting Pot like other First World countries yeah I think that's,210.0,2.667,3.333,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,210.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
it so yours you said that the poor people in Korea,215.0,2.667,3.333,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.0,215.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
are the fault of their own and it's not the government that's what you said and I agree that some,220.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.333,1.333,1.0,220.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
people in might be the case for some people that,225.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.333,1.333,1.0,225.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
I was brought up in the UK and the situation will be different there,230.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.333,1.333,1.0,230.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
is still poor people in Britain but the government,235.0,2.333,2.667,1.667,1.333,1.333,1.0,235.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
helping the poor people is extremely different from Korea and victim,240.0,2.667,2.667,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,240.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
I think the government isn't doing enough to help the disabled,245.0,3.333,2.667,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,245.0,3.333,3.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
or the,250.0,3.333,2.667,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,250.0,3.667,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
old people old people and eventually he'll Etc and people,255.0,3.667,2.667,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,255.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
who need help from the government who can't sustain the,260.0,3.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,260.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
can't help themselves who need help I think that,265.0,3.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,265.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
the government needs to help them more and I'm you said that extreme people add,270.0,3.667,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,270.0,3.0,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
more rule to the religion do you have you study the Cora,275.0,4.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,275.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

because in the UK this is in GCSE we select subjects,285.0,3.667,2.667,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,285.0,3.333,3.333,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
and I selected religion I'm that about Muslims and the Quran and the Quran,290.0,3.333,2.667,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,290.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
I can't cook the crumbs I don't remember the exact words but it says,295.0,4.0,2.667,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,295.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
to kill non-muslims and kill the,300.0,3.667,2.667,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,300.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
gays kill the tried convert everyone to Muslim if they don't,305.0,3.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,305.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

and they make them all Muslim and attack on Muslims and if you kill someone because,320.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,320.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
of the religion you go to heaven okay,325.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,325.0,2.333,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
rebuttal time okay first I'll address your welfare,330.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,330.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
comment yeah so I think I,335.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,335.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
would agree with you maybe you came would have a better welfare situation,340.0,2.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,340.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
and comparisons to Korea right because Korean government,345.0,2.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,345.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
doesn't really do doesn't really care about the disabled disabled or mentally challenged,350.0,2.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,350.0,2.667,2.667,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
all the older generation and I agree with that but that's all in the government,355.0,2.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,355.0,2.333,2.667,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
instead of actually protesting against immigration they should actually be protesting,360.0,2.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,360.0,2.667,3.333,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
for you know rights for welfare status fixing everything,365.0,2.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,365.0,2.667,3.333,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
helping the mentally disabled helping the people helping the older generation maybe with pension,370.0,2.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,370.0,2.667,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
or well first raishin they should actually be protesting for you know rights for welfare status fixing everything helping the mentally disabled helping the people helping the older generation maybe with pension or welfare status that's what they should be fighting for instead of immigration as well,375.0,2.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,375.0,2.333,3.333,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
for a religion otherwise just because the coroner says to kill non-muslims,380.0,2.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,380.0,2.333,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
it's like the Bible they're like Stone everybody who is a sinner or stone people who don't,385.0,2.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,385.0,2.333,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0

only the extremist why isn't there any Christian extremist who do that throw stones,410.0,2.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,410.0,2.333,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
at the case kill people who commit adultery,415.0,2.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,415.0,2.333,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
it says in the Bible to kill Stone but that's only,420.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.333,2.0,1.0,420.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.667,2.333,1.0
a morality thing yeah to Christians as some of your morality did you see American,425.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.333,2.0,1.0,425.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.667,2.333,1.0
Muslims killing with non-muslims know you don't that would be an everyday occurrence in America,430.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.333,2.0,1.0,430.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.667,2.333,1.0
exactly so I don't think it all but not all of them follow,435.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.333,2.0,1.0,435.0,3.667,3.333,2.0,2.0,2.333,1.0
but,440.0,3.667,2.667,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.0,440.0,3.667,3.333,2.0,1.667,2.333,1.0
are they actually call themselves Muslims or do,445.0,3.667,2.667,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.0,445.0,3.333,3.0,2.0,1.667,2.333,1.0
they call themselves another word for their terrorist group it depends,450.0,4.0,3.0,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.0,450.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.667,2.333,1.0
they call themselves Muslims so you're saying that terrorist,455.0,4.0,3.0,1.667,2.0,2.0,1.0,455.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.667,2.333,1.0
people don't call themselves Muslims some don't some were just,460.0,3.667,3.667,1.667,2.0,2.0,1.0,460.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.667,2.333,1.0
a group that there were an activist are trying to defend their own country and then they ended up,465.0,3.667,3.333,1.667,2.0,1.667,1.0,465.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.667,2.333,1.0
getting the support of America and they became this huge terrorist groups like,470.0,3.667,3.333,1.667,2.0,1.667,1.0,470.0,3.333,3.333,2.0,1.667,2.333,1.0
for example Isis,475.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,2.0,2.0,1.0,475.0,3.0,3.333,2.0,1.667,2.333,1.0
so how is Isis so huge where is happening make money they got,480.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.0,480.0,3.0,2.667,2.0,1.667,2.333,1.0
their first support from the US and then when Saddam Hussein died,485.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.0,485.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.667,2.333,1.0
they go bigger how did they grew bigger where did they get all the equipment the weapons,490.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.0,490.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.667,2.333,1.0
they got the Weaponry from the America before before said I was saying died so they,495.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.0,495.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.667,2.333,1.0
got all the weapons before silencing and they're still have those weapons,500.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.0,500.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.667,2.333,1.0
yeah and then they sell was weapons being fine they gain followers followers make - definitely a huge support,505.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.0,505.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.667,2.333,1.0
from some certain government and most people assume that it's from Saudia,510.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.0,510.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.667,2.333,1.0
Arabia now it's prob maybe Saudi Arabia but in the beginning are why is Sandy Arabia,515.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.0,515.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,2.333,2.333,1.0
supporting the Isis because the Muslim Brotherhood,520.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.667,2.0,1.0,520.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.667,2.333,1.0
the Muslim idea what Isis is doing is they're doing exactly,525.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.667,2.0,1.0,525.0,3.667,3.333,2.0,1.667,2.333,1.0
what the Quran is very saying then what is a bomb their own mosque,530.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.667,2.0,1.0,530.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.667,2.333,1.0
they didn't bomb their own laws they terrorize their own walk and it's not like every Muslim,535.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.667,2.0,1.0,535.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.667,2.333,1.0
is a terrorist if everyone's,540.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.667,2.0,1.0,540.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.667,2.333,1.0
I'm saying terrorists are Muslim but not every,545.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.667,2.0,1.0,545.0,3.333,3.0,2.0,1.667,2.333,1.0
Muslim is a terrorist then not every terrorist is a Muslim,550.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.333,1.667,1.0,550.0,3.333,3.0,2.0,1.667,2.333,1.0
look the most terrorists are Muslim but then they,555.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.333,1.667,1.0,555.0,3.333,3.0,2.0,1.667,2.333,1.0
do we tap whose turn is it 10,560.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.333,1.333,1.0,560.0,3.667,3.0,1.667,1.333,2.333,1.0
first these refugees came,5.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
from your men right and they left because the their country at the Terrors and regime was being,10.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,1.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
because they thought the country was dangerous after all and,15.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,15.0,1.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
they have nowhere to go and Korea is a developed Nation also part of the United Nations,20.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,20.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
I think they have the responsibility to take in the refugees SL pasta,25.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,25.0,2.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
okay so again is the refugee letting the refugee into,30.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,30.0,2.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Jeju Island because first of all they are abusing The Immigrant love which is,35.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,35.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.333
well first of all judges like a visa-free island so they can stay for 30,40.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,40.0,2.333,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
days but after that they have to go out but if they challenge,45.0,2.333,2.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,45.0,2.333,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
for a trial at the court to let them into can stay for additional 90 days and,50.0,2.667,2.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,50.0,2.0,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
and of Korean government has to provide like food shelter and,55.0,2.333,2.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,55.0,2.0,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
even for kids they have to provide Public Health Care and education so,60.0,2.333,2.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,60.0,2.0,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
I think they're kind of abusing that system and second of all I think it's bit,65.0,2.667,2.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,65.0,2.667,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
premature for both the refugees and Korean people to accept,70.0,2.667,2.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,70.0,2.667,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
each other for example Yemen is in the Middle East so it's,75.0,2.667,2.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,75.0,2.667,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
to the culture and like the food in general is different from Korea so,80.0,2.333,2.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,80.0,2.0,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
for the Koreans it's hard to understand them and also,85.0,2.333,2.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,85.0,2.0,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
for the young man is will be quite hard to settle down in Korea so yeah I didn't,90.0,2.333,2.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,90.0,2.333,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
think there is responsibility for Korea to Lieutenant,95.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,95.0,2.333,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
okay Point she said that they are abusing the law but the question of the debate is whether Korea should,100.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,100.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
accept the refugees and therefore the law is not the issue if they're abusing the law we can change the law,105.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,105.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
so that they can stay in more legally without using the sides,110.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,110.0,2.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
gates in the law and the second you said that Koreans and Muslims are so different that it's it's not realistic that they live together,115.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,115.0,2.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
but we have seen many cases in history like Germany and France everything,120.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,120.0,2.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
thousands of refugees and they have done,125.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,125.0,2.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
well and in contrast Korea is only old as Korea,130.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,130.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
only has to accept like 550 refugees which is a very small portion compared to what,135.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,135.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
countries like Germany and France are doing and he said that Muslims,140.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,140.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
will have difficulties settling in Korea but they don't have any choices they chose Korea,145.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,145.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
because at least it's better than staying in their home country,150.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,150.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
so I think the refugees don't have a choice,155.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,155.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
and it's it's rather an obligation that they stayed here,160.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,160.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0
so for the first point of argument is that,165.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,165.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
they are abusing the law and so there was a petition to the blue house,170.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,170.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
where the people were like change the law to not,175.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,175.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
not let the Immigrant in and so what the government did was to change the law and excluded,180.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,180.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
your man from Visa free program so from now on except for the 550,185.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,185.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
people who are all already inside the Jeju Island o Maryam and people,190.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,190.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
can come in so from now on it illegal and second,195.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,195.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
difference Germany and yeah I think they should let the immigrants in,200.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,200.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
because let me think about all those crises originated from is from,205.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,205.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
the colonial period when the European countries invaded Africa and,210.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,210.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
set the ruler rulers in their own taste so they have like historical responsibilities,215.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,215.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
to let immigrants in but for example Korea don't have any kind of those connections,220.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,220.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
to military Middle East Country so yeah I don't think there is,225.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,225.0,3.0,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
I think rather than Korea maybe European countries who,230.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,230.0,2.667,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
created all those meth should let those immigrants thing right,235.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,235.0,3.0,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
you said that the law makes the refugees movements illegal but,240.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,240.0,2.667,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
the question of the debate is whether that should be legal or illegal so whether the laws are illegal,245.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,245.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
right now is irrelevant from this debate because that's what we are deciding right now whether we should change the laws so that,250.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,250.0,3.333,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
refugees should be accepted into Korea and the second you said that,255.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,255.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
France and Germany are different because they have historic ties to the Muslim countries,260.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0,260.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
but but Korea also part,265.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0,265.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
of the United Nations has signed at the convention so they also have the international obligation,270.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0,270.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
to accept refugees when there is a crisis and also,275.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0,275.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
German is certainly not accepting the refugees because they have historical responsibilities,280.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0,280.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
to Syrian refugees sexually though relationship is very weak between Syria and,285.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0,285.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
Germany it's not like Germany and Israel and so but they are accepting the refugees,290.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0,290.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
because that's the that's the so it's that's the sort of behavior,295.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0,295.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
they must show as a developed country and Korea to is a developed country and it,300.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0,300.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
is very capable of accepting 550 refugees when countries like France and Germany are accepting,305.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0,305.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
"100,000 refugees every year so I think refugees",310.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0,310.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
should be learning so although they're like 550 people if you,315.0,3.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,315.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
make exceptions for those if Yemen crisis,320.0,3.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,320.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
that will fertile lead into other immigrants in the future which might probably more,325.0,3.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,325.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
and more that's what that's how the European immigrant crisis started and,330.0,3.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,330.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
also lots of European countries and lots of European countries most of,335.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,335.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
most of the students are against the refugee because cauldrons bit different and they cause like,340.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,340.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
social confusion so I think those kind of confusion will be even much,345.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,345.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
larger in Korea because the culture itself is,350.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,350.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
two different and also although there is no like confirmation,355.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,355.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
that they actually create like a crime the people in Jeju,360.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,360.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Island feel like with anger from them even one of my friends who's from Georgia Island always,365.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,365.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
talks about about that thing and she sometimes though them and she doesn't want to see,370.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,370.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
those people there so yeah I think it's for,375.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,375.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
the for the Yemen people yeah it is TRUE that,380.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,380.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
we should take care of them for a while but after the crisis settle down they,385.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,385.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
should go back but I'm not sure whether they will try to stake in Korea even further because,390.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,390.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
it is developed country yes I'm bit confused about that,395.0,2.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,395.0,2.667,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
well you have said that French,400.0,2.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,400.0,2.667,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
and German people are against a refugees movements and that's because there are so,405.0,2.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,405.0,3.0,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"many refugees moving into those countries every year it's about 100,000 refugees were talking",410.0,2.667,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,410.0,2.667,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
about for European cases but for a career it's less than thousand and and I believe,415.0,2.667,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,415.0,2.667,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
they fact of the refugees on Korean Society is much smaller compared to the effect,420.0,2.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,420.0,2.667,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
that the refugees are bringing on to the European societies and therefore the and objection will be,425.0,2.667,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,425.0,2.667,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
lower as well and also we have to know that,430.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,430.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
the judge island is a special case because once the refugees moving to the judge Island their economic activities,435.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,435.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
will be limited to those in Jeju Island it will not affect the most,440.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,440.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
part of Korea and certainly we can therefore conclude that the effect of refugees and Korean,445.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,445.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
societies very low and therefore all these objections against the refugees,450.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,450.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
are very exaggerated with they are based,455.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,455.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
on baseless misconceptions that we Muslims are potential terrorists,460.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,460.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
criminals and Korea now has to move from a society where these,465.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,465.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
misconceptions should no longer have effect on people's minds,470.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,470.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
okay so my think about that is that they're not,475.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,475.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
limited to Jeju Island the Muslim people well actually there was a news report by Korean news agency,480.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,480.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
that there was a Facebook group consisted of like 150 Yemen,485.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,485.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
man and five Koreans were five Korean people were brokers who,490.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,490.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
made like a ship that led the German people moved to the Korean Mainland,495.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,495.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
because at first the judges City whole tried to give and when people drop,500.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,500.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
to the like the fisherman Tom to help the features catch the fish in the sea,505.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,505.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
but they re they yeah at first they tried to do this job but they insisted that the,510.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,510.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
wage is too low and they made a Facebook group and some of them actually went to Korea,515.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,515.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Mainland and was on the news report so I don't think there will be confined to the Jesuit,520.0,2.667,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,520.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Island and also although Korea is a default developed,525.0,2.667,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,525.0,2.667,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0
country in well well defined,530.0,2.667,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,530.0,2.667,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0
term I don't think it is developed country it is somewhere between the developing,535.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,535.0,2.667,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0
and developed country like there is like almost a double-double,540.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0,540.0,2.667,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0
difference of an income for those European countries or United States so,545.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0,545.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
yeah I don't I don't think there's enough Wells for Korean government to support,550.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0,550.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
the future immigration but would you agree that at least Korea is more developed,555.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0,555.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
than Yemen that's TRUE and would you agree that Korea is a more developed,560.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,560.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
Nation who has signed the UN agreement for refugees has an international,565.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,565.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
obligation to take in refugees yeah then you agree that Korea has,570.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,570.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
the obligation to take refugees and therefore it must take it are they fine for the,575.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,575.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
UN immigration but that does not mean that they have to take them a I haven't,580.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,580.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
read the UN Refugee act perfectly but the Korea doesn't have,585.0,2.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,585.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
enough wealth to support and then the current young,590.0,3.333,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,590.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
people young Generations have don't have jobs so why should you use tax on them to support,595.0,3.0,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,595.0,3.333,4.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
them while even the Korean people don't have enough jobs and even like the,600.0,3.333,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,600.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
veterans who joined the Korean War skill,605.0,3.333,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,605.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
still living in poverty but before you agreed that,610.0,3.0,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,610.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
Korea is a developed Nation compared to Yemen yeah would you agree that as a developed Nation,615.0,3.667,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,615.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
"it has capacity to take in at least 1,000 foreigners but",620.0,3.667,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,620.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
Dad might lead into like potential crisis because those if we let those immigrants,625.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,625.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.333,1.0,1.0
in they leak to Korean Mainland and even will further like,630.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,630.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.333,1.0,1.0
the social problems larger the news reports,635.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,635.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
that yeah so do you really believe that these 550 people,640.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,640.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
pose real threats against 50 million Koreans because it's being made,645.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,645.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
exclusion for them even more young people will come to Korea because of that,650.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,650.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
not even young man but even other Middle East and for example like South America,655.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,655.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Venezuela so if they make exclusion to the case if can future be addressed to Korean,660.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,660.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
immigrant acts but certainly it will,665.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,665.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
it starts not when you make me did you know how USA become the strongest country,5.0,2.0,2.333,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

something they wanted job because of the painting and colony,60.0,2.0,2.333,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,60.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
without these are finished and a Spanish from medical,65.0,2.0,2.333,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,65.0,2.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0

without those things USA had not become more powerful country,75.0,1.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,75.0,2.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
and the most powerful country in the world without the Multicultural multi culture of salad,80.0,1.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,80.0,2.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
bowl the thing,85.0,1.667,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.667,1.0,85.0,2.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
the we should ban refugees is going is perpetually,90.0,2.333,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.667,1.0,90.0,2.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
not logical thing,95.0,2.333,2.333,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,95.0,2.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
I understand your idea but I think the case of USA,100.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.667,1.0,100.0,2.333,2.667,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
is a case of 30 of like almost a century ago,105.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.667,1.0,105.0,2.333,2.667,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
and it should be up to occur it shouldn't be applicable to now because as you can see,110.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,110.0,2.333,2.667,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
if you refer to other examples in countries like European countries like Germany,115.0,3.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,115.0,2.0,2.667,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
French Greece or turkey they actually face a lot of problems regarding their Refugee,120.0,3.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,2.667,1.0,120.0,2.0,2.667,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
because I think Germany and France and Greece,125.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.667,1.0,125.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
have problems but how about turkey turkey is not actually they only put the,130.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,130.0,2.667,2.333,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
refugee inside the camp they don't let the few Fuji outside of the camp I didn't even know what,135.0,4.0,2.333,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,135.0,2.667,2.333,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
the news that turkey has receiving the refugees except for Syria,140.0,4.0,2.333,1.0,1.0,2.667,1.0,140.0,2.667,2.333,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
except for Syria they actually put the if you read the news,145.0,4.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,145.0,2.667,2.333,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
they actually put a refugee in the candidate they actually warned that they got to release the refugee from the can,150.0,3.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,2.667,1.0,150.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
as a warning sign for like a kind of risk,155.0,4.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.667,1.0,155.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
or a threat to the u.s. to the European Union so I believe that,160.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.667,1.0,160.0,2.667,2.333,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
they actually have to Refugee and they just use a lot of refugee at one of the threat but I think that's not,165.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.667,1.0,165.0,2.667,2.333,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
my main argument my been argument here is that by putting,170.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,170.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
us at the strongest is why not be applicable to the current situation right now and,175.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,175.0,2.667,2.333,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
if we look at Korea Korea is actually not voluntary,180.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.667,1.0,180.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
accepting the refugee at comparing to u.s. u.s. actually they welcome the refugee as one of the wave,185.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.667,1.0,185.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
of their country to develop but career has already developed and this infrastructure and Miss political,190.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,190.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
system is not suitable ooh for receiving the profusion I don't,195.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.667,1.0,195.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
think so I don't think so Korea needs to be better off Korea s,200.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,200.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0

good idea about Korea that should be the way to new breakthrough,215.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.667,2.667,1.0,215.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0
to the way of Korea to say oh they're Market to,220.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.667,2.0,1.0,220.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0
that means Yemen or Syria or something countries,225.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,225.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0

and now it now pour the Korea the other countries Iraq,235.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.667,2.0,1.0,235.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0
and Syria Europe and turkey I can turkey should be banned for this argument,240.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,2.333,1.0,240.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0
turkey is not it,245.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,2.333,1.0,245.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0
can be seen grilled it for this problem we should we should make a can,250.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,2.333,1.0,250.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0
inside of Jeju Island to poor refugees not ready now the topper images,255.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0,255.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0
we should make a camp it is Jeju Island is not a can its nature,260.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,2.333,1.0,260.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0
people and repudiate the harmony call refugees,265.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.667,2.667,1.0,265.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0
but regarding the development of Korea I think that is,270.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.667,2.333,1.0,270.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0
it better to focus on Korean people first when you develop Korea because Korean people that,275.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.667,2.667,1.0,275.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0
read the core resources of Korea like Korea hasn't is used to be a homogeneous country so,280.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.667,2.667,1.0,280.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0
even with Korean people do they actually you guys actually was able to develop into,285.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.667,2.333,1.0,285.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0
one of the main power in the world so isn't keep focusing on Korean people,290.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.667,2.667,1.0,290.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0
is one of the way to develop to develop Korea a better country,295.0,2.333,2.333,1.0,1.333,2.667,1.0,295.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0
in the future and talking about Korean people actually do you the Yemen if Yugi,300.0,2.333,2.333,1.0,1.333,2.667,1.0,300.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0
in in Jeju Island actually cause a lot of trouble for Korean people like,305.0,2.333,2.333,1.0,1.333,2.667,1.0,305.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0
the people who residing in Korea and they actually stick to seven cases of Korean,310.0,2.333,2.333,1.0,1.333,2.667,1.0,310.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0
woman who actually got adopted by Korean I buy the gemenese refugee,315.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.667,2.333,1.0,315.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.333,1.0
so isn't it isn't it isn't it the focus of Korean people to protect is,320.0,3.333,2.333,1.0,1.667,2.333,1.0,320.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.333,1.0
is countrymen first instead of receiving those people from oversea,325.0,3.333,2.333,1.0,1.333,2.333,1.0,325.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.333,1.0
and and in order for example if you want to get them in I,330.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,330.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.333,1.0
want to get the refugee and just in case that you need to have a real treatment like a huge amount of,335.0,3.333,2.333,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,335.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0
resources to actually build cam or actually have a proper way for,340.0,3.333,2.333,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,340.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0
the Yemen people to actually mingle with the Korean people because Korean is actually,345.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,345.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0
as I said people are homogeneous country so they don't really accept International people from over C,350.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.333,2.0,1.0,350.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0
so in that case I think Korean people need to change a lot and need to invest a lot not just in not such like,355.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.333,2.0,1.0,355.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0
in resources but also in their mindset in order to,360.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,360.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0
accept the refugee and help them to become Korean,365.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,1.333,2.333,1.0,365.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0
North Korea is not luck now the homogeneous flow Theory anymore Priyanka I have had receiving,370.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,370.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0
refugees from especially girls from the rural side,375.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,375.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0

So Korea s rural side has decreasing continuously decreasing people,385.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,385.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0
so we should we should get refugees for the,390.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,390.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0

of immigrant from other country right but most of them as far as I know come from Asian country and,455.0,2.0,2.333,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,455.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
for example Vietnam China or other nearby country however,460.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,460.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
Yemen is very different from,465.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.667,1.0,465.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
all from those people from that country because Yemen they actually come from far,470.0,2.0,2.333,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,470.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0

really different from what Korea or with make their culture is very different from,480.0,2.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,480.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
what Korean people are facing right now China and other Asian cultures in many,485.0,2.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,485.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
different from Korean culture actually I'm from the myself and I think that the difference is,490.0,2.0,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,490.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
between Vietnamese Vietnamese people in Korea people are very smaller compared to Yemen people,495.0,2.0,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,495.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
and Korean people because Vietnam and Korea are both,500.0,2.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0,500.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
Confucius countries which make our court ending or core culture,505.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.667,1.0,505.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
are unrelated Lisa Miller in some way the four young men there are from east,510.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,510.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0
from the littlest which make their core religion is,515.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,515.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0
yes I say Muslim which is two very different from Korean,520.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,520.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0
culture and perspective so I think it's gonna take a much more time and effort to actually mingle the yemenis,525.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,525.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0
people to the Korean people and help them to settle down Korea,530.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.333,1.0,530.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0
so and because of those differences of actually cause some kind of fear and some kind,535.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,2.333,1.0,535.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0
of a kind of resistance from the Korean people to accept the amendment which in a way,540.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.333,2.333,1.0,540.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,2.0,1.333,1.0
to make the game and difficult to settle here and make the curry and less likely to accept,545.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,545.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,2.0,1.333,1.0
the images so I think we should also take kircher different as one of the,550.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.333,1.0,550.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.0
point to consider when we whether we should take care of it Yemen is refusing to Curry,555.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,555.0,2.667,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0
that's why I have to receive this I have many,560.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,560.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0
time is over,565.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.333,1.0,565.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0
no and you may be good yeah,5.0,2.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.667,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
I think that Korea Government should be,10.0,2.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,2.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
Korean government should shoot like that,15.0,1.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,15.0,1.667,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
yeah minion people to come to Korea to get their Asylum status,20.0,1.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,20.0,1.667,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
and there is a reasons firstly,25.0,1.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,25.0,2.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
it's I think that it's time for Korea to break down the Monokuma no culturalism,30.0,2.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,30.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
as you know Korea Korea has like consist creates consists of like only 12 people like which is,35.0,2.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,35.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
Asian so it's not really comfortable for Koreans to live with,40.0,1.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,40.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
people from other countries however as time passes many people,45.0,1.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,45.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
starts to come through yet and I think that,50.0,2.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,50.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
it's time for Korean government to understand did what would you,55.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,55.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
call diversity and secondly some people worried for,60.0,2.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,60.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
the bad people would come to Korea do,65.0,2.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,65.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
for us alone status but it can be sold by strict screening,70.0,1.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,70.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
and early the people amount of people of them is really low like 0.02 percent so it will not affect,75.0,2.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,75.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
the safety of Korea,80.0,2.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,80.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
it's okay that Korea has said,85.0,2.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,85.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
brightness but German people,90.0,1.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,90.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
are going to tell you which is a tourist Island and as you know the main religion,95.0,3.0,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,95.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
or seven people are Islam and they don't have good reputation,100.0,2.333,3.333,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,100.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
worldwide and that can affect the tourist in Jeju some people are not comfortable,105.0,2.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,105.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
with the idea of having Muslim people around in the zoo because of,110.0,2.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,110.0,2.333,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
what has happened throughout history for someone in you know in the u.s.,115.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,115.0,2.333,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
many terrorist attack are,120.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,120.0,2.667,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
dumb by Muslims and Europe,125.0,2.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,125.0,2.667,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
some fresh veggies are known for I'm not not,130.0,2.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,130.0,2.667,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
at not accepting the loss in Europe but try to force Islam,135.0,2.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,135.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
so I think that because of be Muslim,140.0,2.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,140.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
in our freezer area they should not allow that because,145.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,145.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
it can affect economy it can affect security of the people,150.0,2.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,150.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
it can affect how people,155.0,2.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,155.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
look,160.0,2.667,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,160.0,2.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
the safeness of Corey as a whole,165.0,2.0,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,165.0,2.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
you have mentioned that because the the place,170.0,2.0,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,170.0,2.667,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
where the refugee represents leaves is the place where tourists,175.0,2.333,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,175.0,2.667,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
so it would be bad for the economy of Jeju Island but,180.0,2.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,180.0,3.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
I think that even even refugees can like help,185.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,185.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
help to enhance the general economy for many reasons they can work during,190.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,190.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
their stain Institute so it would promote did other economic something like,195.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,195.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
a comic activity something like building a new apartment or some other places and there is even a,200.0,2.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,200.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
place which sells even he's food so like,205.0,2.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,205.0,2.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
it's it has become a hot place for tourists so there are many reasons,210.0,2.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,210.0,2.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
that can refute that and for safety issue,215.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,215.0,2.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
maybe because it can be worked because of the prejudice,220.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,220.0,2.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
and think of Koreans for,225.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,225.0,2.667,3.667,1.333,1.667,1.333,1.0
Muslim people so I think that it should be break down as soon as possible,230.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,230.0,2.667,3.667,1.333,1.667,1.333,1.0
Dimension,235.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,235.0,2.667,3.667,1.333,1.667,1.333,1.0
work but as far as I know if they only,240.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,240.0,2.667,3.667,1.333,1.667,1.333,1.0
there are only allowed to do minor jobs like pitching,245.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,245.0,2.667,3.667,1.333,1.667,1.333,1.0
working restaurant but that also can,250.0,2.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,250.0,2.667,3.667,1.333,1.667,1.333,1.0
affect how people view that restaurant if they,255.0,2.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,255.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.667,1.333,1.0
know the background of the waitress or waiter,260.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,260.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.667,1.333,1.0
because people from that area area,265.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,265.0,3.667,3.667,1.333,1.667,1.333,1.0
have different culinary customs you know they eat some food,270.0,3.333,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,270.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
with the hounds or J don't wash your hair properly so they can affect how people,275.0,2.333,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,275.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
view their restaurants also you mentioned the food,280.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,280.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
that they make it is TRUE that it can be a corruption but I think it would be a dream for yourself,285.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,285.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
you that knows how many different area or in that area of the world,290.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,290.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
food tastes like but for the,295.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,295.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
majority I don't think that they will attract to Jim and foot because it's not worldwide,300.0,2.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,300.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
known like I don't know people who say oh I want him and feel so good,305.0,2.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,305.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
is,310.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,310.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
it is it all okay yeah for local IT jobs,315.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,315.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
for Jeju Island as I know like there are not many like young people who stays in,320.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,320.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
this room so like I think that there is a lot of demand,325.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,325.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
for the local jobs that you mentioned something like the fishing and like it will,330.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,330.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
be possible to be adapted for some something like sports tennis,335.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,335.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
collecting tangerines or something like that so I think it,340.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,340.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
means people can work at their and and you have,345.0,2.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,345.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
there and continue living like this so it would be even,350.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,350.0,2.333,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
but if we double for Jeju Island I think and secondly for the humanist book you mentioned,355.0,2.333,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,355.0,2.333,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
that this because this food is not popular among other people it would be,360.0,2.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,360.0,2.667,3.333,1.667,1.333,1.333,1.0
not like effective as you think but I think that it can be,365.0,2.0,3.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,365.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.333,1.333,1.0
one of the way to increase the multi diversity not only,370.0,2.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,370.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.333,1.333,1.0
in for the Joyland like there's so many Muslim people who stays in,375.0,2.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,375.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.333,1.333,1.0
Korea so like I think it can be like spread over many places and like it,380.0,2.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,380.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.333,1.333,1.0
would be helpful for them to stay and work together,385.0,2.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,385.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.333,1.333,1.0
yep for the minor job that they can do,390.0,2.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,390.0,2.667,3.333,1.667,1.333,1.333,1.0
is to that they can do it because they are young people that look for new house,395.0,2.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,395.0,2.333,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
stuff but by experience for example in,400.0,2.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,400.0,2.333,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
my country a chance to go to my country to look for a job but in the area they live in,405.0,2.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,405.0,2.333,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
they still have bad reputation even though they work hard and people don't,410.0,2.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,410.0,2.333,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
like to live in those area so what is fine because this area are,415.0,2.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,415.0,2.333,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
not tourist attraction but if they live they,420.0,2.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,420.0,2.333,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
will live in a resort area I think people might avoid that area,425.0,2.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,425.0,2.333,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
and look for other options far front from there that's one point,430.0,2.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,430.0,2.333,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
second point is multiculturalism I agree with that,435.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,435.0,2.333,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
multiculturalism is always good but,440.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,440.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
the problem for me is their,445.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,445.0,2.333,3.333,1.667,1.333,1.333,1.0
main religion I'm not saying Islam are bad people but,450.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,450.0,2.0,3.333,1.667,1.333,1.333,1.0
there is a minority if Linda do bad thing and they're very dangerous for example for example in,455.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,455.0,2.0,3.333,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
Philippines Unfortunately they were terrorist attack in the South,460.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,460.0,2.0,3.333,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
because Filipinos a Muslim that came from Malaysia,465.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,465.0,2.0,3.333,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
and that at that keep in the mind of,470.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,470.0,2.0,3.333,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
people still and that can be dangerous,475.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,475.0,2.0,3.333,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
you,480.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,480.0,2.0,3.333,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
have mentioned that if these people lives in nearby,485.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,485.0,2.0,3.333,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
resort places it will be bad for the tourists to come on Mason economic but I think that like if they are,490.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,490.0,2.0,3.333,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
well educated for working in relief resort area and providers night service to them,495.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,495.0,2.0,3.333,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
it will be okay and like if they cannot adapt to the kind of stuff I,500.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,500.0,2.0,3.333,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
think that they should not get allowed to stay in Korea so I think it will be okay,505.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,505.0,2.0,3.333,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
if like if we can like limit people you can't stay any theater by like,510.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,510.0,2.0,3.333,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
considering these factors secondly for the terrorism issue,515.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,515.0,2.333,3.333,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
I think that you are I think that it's,520.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,520.0,2.333,3.333,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
really dangerous because like it means they're like Muslim is the,525.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,525.0,2.667,3.333,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
like potential like terrorists so it will be very prejudiced,530.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,530.0,2.667,3.333,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
idea so I think this practice different oh this should be avoided,535.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,535.0,2.667,3.333,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
that,540.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,540.0,3.0,2.667,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.0
man is over,545.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,545.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
now you may begin okay so I think I will start with,5.0,2.0,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
the fact that Korea is a developed country and the members of you and community members of United,10.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,10.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
Nations and it's also one of the countries who which signed,15.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,15.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
Refugee studies International Convention I think Korea has a duty to take part in the global,20.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,20.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
effort to deal with this yam and civil Civil War which has been saved as,25.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,25.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
a one of the most one of the worst human who met humanitarian crisis,30.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,30.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
ever experienced in the 20th 21st century and,35.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.0,1.0,35.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
I think Korea so far participate on a little compared to,40.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.667,1.0,40.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
"other countries such as Malaysia about 20,000 refugees stayed four 99-year",45.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.667,1.0,45.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
in Malaysia and also in Germany there about,50.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.667,1.0,50.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
hundreds thousands of refugees so I'll start with that and,55.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.667,1.0,55.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
I also believe that public,60.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.667,1.0,60.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
people of Korea mostly use fear and intuition in judging the issue and government,65.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,2.667,1.0,65.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
have a responsibility to stick with the objective of that and,70.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,2.333,1.0,70.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
deal with it more responsibly I think I'll stop them,75.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.333,2.333,1.0,75.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
here I partly agree with your idea and it's,80.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,2.333,1.0,80.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
not like I'm saying I'm totally against accepting people from you man and he took an example,85.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.333,2.333,1.0,85.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
of Malaysia and Germany but you have to consider that like cultural and the sentiment,90.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,2.333,1.0,90.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
is really kind of different because you know Korea is like in your slowly opening,95.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.333,2.333,1.0,95.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
up to mulch Multicultural Concepts and all that so people here,100.0,2.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,100.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
are very slow conservative about all these issues so I'm not saying that we of this whole,105.0,2.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,105.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
like humanitarian approach to accepting people but aside from that we should have like legal institutions,110.0,2.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,110.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
and systematic approach to how to stack people and sort of like integrate these,115.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,115.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
people into the community so that should be the first assignment in Korean government and,120.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,120.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
I'm not saying that we should just stop accepting all those people because of fear and,125.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,125.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
intuition and xenophobic phobic is definitely not tolerated but there,130.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,130.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
are aside from that there are many problems in Korea as well which are,135.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,135.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
happening in this country and you know the priority of Korea should be Korean people first so we,140.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,140.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
should put Korean people first and there are diminished I heard that there,145.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,145.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
are diminishing rate of Tours because there are many young men people there so people,150.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,150.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
kind of feel like well this is not Korea so,155.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.333,155.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
yes so I think we should consider accepting them in systematic,160.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.333,160.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
manner not just accepting them and humanitarian,165.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.667,1.333,165.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
okay so I think many of the problems like economic problems,170.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.667,1.333,170.0,2.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Etc when related to the Yemen issue I think it's blown out of proportion,175.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.667,1.333,175.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
because right now the Yemen refugees are only about 500 and it's not,180.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.667,1.333,180.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
going to affect too much into the Korean economy and I think increasing,185.0,2.333,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.667,1.333,185.0,3.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
it is it's not going to affect too much into the big scale of the,190.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.667,1.333,190.0,3.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Korean economy and also I have doubt that the,195.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,2.0,1.667,1.333,195.0,3.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
tourists is affected like tourists Jeju Island to is going to judge you island is affected,200.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,2.0,1.667,1.333,200.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
because there are more young people because again the numbers only 500 and also,205.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333,205.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
I think I heard also the case where,210.0,2.667,3.333,1.667,1.667,1.333,1.333,210.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
there's a murder like a corpse is found and it's,215.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.333,215.0,3.0,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
like people are saying well this is because of the refugee and everything but it turns out to be FALSE so I think,220.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.333,220.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.667
yeah many of these issues are blown out of proportion yeah,225.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.333,225.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.667
I think in a condemnation tore,230.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.333,230.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.667
them without any you know sort of justifiable reason is not acceptable and,235.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.333,235.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.667
you said it's a slow proportion and maybe it is,240.0,2.667,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.333,240.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.667
it is small portion proportionate absolute number but I think how,245.0,2.667,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.333,245.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.667
people actually feel feel about the number is not small because Korea is,250.0,2.667,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.333,250.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.667
not really that Tidwell you know sort of like living together with people,255.0,2.667,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.333,255.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.667
from different cultures and all that so I'm not and also I read in the news article,260.0,2.667,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.333,260.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.667
that there are not like enough like shelter and like system systems I can,265.0,2.667,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.333,265.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.667
actually provide them provides them like comfort and safety,270.0,2.667,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.333,270.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.667
so we should so maybe it's a small proportion but,275.0,2.667,3.333,1.667,1.667,2.0,1.333,275.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.667
for now everything is sort of drastic and too soon for Koreans to actually come up with,280.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.667,1.333,1.333,280.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333
a graph solutions to accept more people so I think maybe slowly accepting,285.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.667,1.333,1.333,285.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333
them is okay for people to actually get used to their culture and all,290.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333,290.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333
that and sort of get over the you know hatred and fear to just you know kick,295.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333,295.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333
kick kick them out of the country so that is acceptable and,300.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333,300.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333
I I sort of agree with people fear because in cases,305.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333,305.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333
like Germany Peach Germany actually assess accepted a lot of refugees,310.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,2.0,310.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333
people from so I really like Merck like right Germany girls,315.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,2.0,315.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333
like saying that it's like Collective rate like called tacos,320.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,2.0,320.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333
so sort of cases they that people get from Korean people get from like news sort of,325.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,2.0,325.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333
threatens them so you I think it's I think it's,330.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,2.0,330.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333
it's bad to just you know blame them without any reason but I also I,335.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,2.0,335.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333
think I can under as a Korean I can understand that people fear,340.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,2.0,340.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333
okay so yeah that kind of tragic,345.0,2.333,3.333,1.333,1.667,1.333,1.333,345.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333
incident happened and it's very sad,350.0,2.333,3.333,1.333,1.667,1.333,1.333,350.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333
but I would say that it's very underrated cases and usually the media,355.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333,355.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333
is the one to blame which like blow it out of proportion so that people get to,360.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333,360.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333
fear Foreigner Foreigner are raping girls and everything so,365.0,3.333,2.333,1.0,2.333,1.333,2.333,365.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.333
again I think the of Korean government and Korea and,370.0,3.667,2.333,1.0,2.333,1.333,2.333,370.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333
educated people are too yeah to educate,375.0,3.667,2.333,1.0,2.333,1.333,2.333,375.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333
general public that this these are not the case this this this,380.0,3.333,2.333,1.0,2.333,1.333,2.333,380.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333
case are just minority is just not really because these people need help immediately,385.0,3.333,2.333,1.0,2.333,1.333,2.333,385.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333
something like that so that and also okay so you mentioned that,390.0,3.333,2.333,1.0,2.333,1.333,2.333,390.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333
accepting them eventually will be okay but looking from the post,395.0,3.333,2.333,1.0,2.333,1.333,2.333,395.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333
ders and the protest that people people bring,400.0,3.333,2.333,1.0,2.333,2.0,2.333,400.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.333,1.333
paper saying fake refugees and everything I doubt that if there is no change,405.0,3.333,2.333,1.0,2.333,2.0,2.333,405.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
Korean like these Professor will change their attitude toward foreigners so,410.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,410.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
I don't really buy that even making like,415.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,415.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
more making slower effort to accept refugees to Korea would change people,420.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,420.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
attitude so I think yeah Korean people need to,425.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,425.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
okay need to have more drastic and more dramatic yeah more changes,430.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,430.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
more drastic well first off in my opinion people,435.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,435.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
who actually like to put take part in the sort of like protest or people who have really sort of extreme,440.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,2.0,2.333,2.0,440.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
stance against like foreigners and they don't really have like Justified reason or like Logic,445.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,2.0,2.333,2.0,445.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
for that so I'm sorry for that but what well and I think,450.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,2.0,2.333,2.0,450.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
accepting them for their safety and all that is acceptable and but my one concern,455.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,2.0,2.333,2.0,455.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
is that actually we have people are,460.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,2.0,2.333,2.0,460.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
afraid of accepting refugees well I heard from I read,465.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,2.0,2.333,2.0,465.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
I watched the documentary that most people who come to Korea,470.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,2.0,2.333,2.0,470.0,2.333,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
but my one concern is that there might be some cases in which people who disguise,475.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,2.0,2.333,2.0,475.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
themselves as Refugee but like who have like political or like religious,480.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,2.0,2.333,2.0,480.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
sort of purpose like biases because I because in one,485.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,2.0,2.333,2.0,485.0,2.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0
new store to go all one people from Indonesia which is different country but disguise,490.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,2.0,2.333,2.0,490.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
himself as just foreign worker but turned out to be part of is it was,495.0,3.0,2.667,1.0,2.0,2.333,2.0,495.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
one big issue so how my one concern is if we accept if,500.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,500.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
we start accepting more of these people how are we going to weed out some potential like,505.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,505.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Risk that's my one concern but most of like children women and people who are,510.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,510.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
in dire need of me definitely should be definitely should be accepted so yeah that is my concern,515.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,515.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
I mean,520.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,520.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
it's it's TRUE that those guys happened and I,525.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,525.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
tend to believe that Korea has a very sophisticated system I mean the Korea has been accepting many,530.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,530.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
immigrants not only refugees and I'm one of the like foreigners,535.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,535.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
in Korea so I think Korea has already already has a sophisticated way of dealing,540.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,540.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
with immigrants so I tend to believe just,545.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.333,545.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
creates capable if Korea wants to create scab mobile screening those tracks,550.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,2.333,1.667,1.333,550.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
that's my son and,555.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,2.333,1.667,1.333,555.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
yeah I agree with it so,560.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,2.333,1.667,1.333,560.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
we will end the debate,565.0,3.333,2.667,1.0,2.333,1.667,1.333,565.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
we'll start now okay in my opinions about your,5.0,2.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,5.0,2.333,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
Refugee from Gmail in South Korea at Jeju Islands,10.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,10.0,2.333,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
I think that is would be have some positive,15.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,15.0,2.333,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
benefits if the Korean government letter reality,20.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,20.0,2.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
into the country with some restrictions and more over than that,25.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,25.0,2.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
the Koreans has already decided to un Refugee convention,30.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,30.0,2.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
in 1991 22,35.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,35.0,2.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
to approve or to,40.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,40.0,2.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
guarantee the status of refugee in the state something,45.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,45.0,2.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
that has and also to compare to another country,50.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,50.0,2.667,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
in Europe and Country like Germany does have more very crisis in,55.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,55.0,2.333,4.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
the refugee problems or issues more than,60.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,60.0,2.333,4.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
"700,000 but in Korean agreement is geez is",65.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,65.0,2.333,4.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
only 550 people so it is the first thing that I think,70.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,70.0,2.667,4.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
the Korean government should accept this group of refugees,75.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,75.0,2.667,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
okay yeah that,80.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,80.0,2.667,4.333,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
I agree with you with that okay Korean just side of convention in 1991,85.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,85.0,2.667,4.333,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
but I just think that it's like a special,90.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,90.0,2.667,4.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
case for the Koreans who have like their their bodies the is like with the,95.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,95.0,3.0,4.667,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
XO phobia sometimes and they're just like care about the conditioned living,100.0,4.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,100.0,3.0,4.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0
so I think if you think about your population first and there are some so very that,105.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,105.0,3.0,4.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0
have or these away that there are more populous proportion of,110.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,110.0,3.0,4.667,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Korean population so I just thing that if you just,115.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,115.0,3.0,4.667,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
do four follow the convention is,120.0,3.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,120.0,3.667,4.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
not the best way to be the good just for the country,125.0,3.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,125.0,3.667,4.333,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0
but you have to look and take care your place and also it was like,130.0,3.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,130.0,3.667,4.333,1.667,1.0,2.333,1.0
if you listen your people first,135.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,135.0,3.667,4.333,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0
it will be good so I think it's not good if we accept all,140.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,140.0,3.667,4.333,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0
yemenis gratuities at Jeju Island yeah but,145.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,145.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
I think do appropriate of the,150.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,150.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
refugees in Korean butter with your vested actually is just,155.0,3.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0,155.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
2.40% from 1994 the sin that,160.0,3.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0,160.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.333,1.0
the first time that Korea and South Korean government except the a refugee and,165.0,3.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0,165.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.333,1.0
but actually it's fun up to none up until now the,170.0,3.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.333,1.0,170.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
government also consider walls of the South Korean citizens and,175.0,3.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.333,1.0,175.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.667,1.0
by that by the consider that they are requirement already,180.0,3.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.333,1.0,180.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.667,1.0
put their game in citizen I already miss,185.0,3.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0,185.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
traveler or citizen that want to come into Korean have to get some result,190.0,3.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0,190.0,3.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
before but so I think this this is a,195.0,3.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0,195.0,2.667,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
slider easiest way for now to deal with this problem,200.0,3.667,3.667,1.667,1.0,2.333,1.0,200.0,2.667,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
and about the signal for beer that you rest I think this stating,205.0,3.667,3.667,1.667,1.0,2.333,1.0,205.0,2.667,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
that if Korean want to be in the Lea Archery internationalized Country,210.0,3.667,3.667,1.667,1.0,2.333,1.0,210.0,2.333,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
or developed country we have or the government's have to educate the,215.0,4.0,3.667,1.667,1.0,2.667,1.0,215.0,2.333,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
currency teaching people how to living in a globalization work,220.0,4.0,3.667,1.667,1.0,2.667,1.0,220.0,2.667,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
I just put,225.0,4.0,3.667,1.667,1.0,2.667,1.0,225.0,2.667,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
the SS right away sir topics now first,230.0,4.0,3.667,1.667,1.0,2.667,1.0,230.0,2.667,3.667,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0
it's like you say Korean government has put the human to the result,235.0,4.0,3.667,1.667,1.0,2.667,1.0,235.0,2.667,3.667,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0
list but it's like if you have like another country's,240.0,4.0,3.667,1.667,1.0,2.667,1.0,240.0,2.667,3.667,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0
or like a cider just do like this again so it's just like,245.0,4.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.333,1.0,245.0,2.667,3.667,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0
Commander being a refugee yeah it's,250.0,4.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.333,1.0,250.0,2.667,3.667,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0
like if some countries just like want to be their equities and comes and do like the yemenis,255.0,4.0,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,255.0,2.667,3.667,2.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
as I think that if they just put the country in the list is,260.0,4.0,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,260.0,2.667,3.667,2.667,1.0,2.333,1.0
not the best way it was the easiest way that yes but it's not the best one it's like,265.0,4.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,265.0,3.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,2.333,1.0
if the there are a lot so the bezel it is like too long,270.0,4.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,270.0,3.0,3.667,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0
and it's not good for the image also yeah and to,275.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,275.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.0
like we don't know like if we,280.0,2.667,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,280.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.0
accept the refugee nothing can guarantee about,285.0,2.667,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,285.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.0
Korean citizens life security and I think also is like the Privacy also,290.0,2.667,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,290.0,2.667,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.333,1.0
so I think so yeah I also accept that,295.0,2.667,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,295.0,2.667,3.667,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
for this comment about a researcher is and also the some highlighter,300.0,2.667,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,300.0,3.0,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
for receive other citizenship of South Korea and but I think,305.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,305.0,2.667,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
Florida to South Korea to policy of accepting a refugee is,310.0,3.333,3.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,310.0,3.0,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
on is also already rigorous for that because of the,315.0,3.333,3.667,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,315.0,3.333,3.667,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
rest of accepting it just only 2%,320.0,3.333,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,320.0,3.0,3.667,1.667,1.0,2.0,1.0
from there over ten thousand Thirty thousands of people,325.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,325.0,3.667,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
to apply for energy but cannot expect but get the rejection from that,330.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,330.0,3.667,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
and by racing there are there are some requests of petition from the,335.0,3.0,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,335.0,4.0,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
citizens of to the Blue House of Korean and,340.0,3.333,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,340.0,3.667,3.667,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
I think the government now considering that to give,345.0,3.333,3.667,1.0,1.0,1.667,1.0,345.0,3.667,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
more deliberate assess or for get for giving their,350.0,3.333,4.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,350.0,3.667,3.667,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0

and also they this,360.0,3.333,4.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,360.0,3.667,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
is some car like they call hit or humanitarians humanitarian visas,365.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0,365.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
that the government only give this result to the refugee,370.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0,370.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
or 31 years to guarantee that when their circumstances so situation the in their their,375.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0,375.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
home country is becoming Wheels good get better and they can,380.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0,380.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
guarantee that they will lead career right,385.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0,385.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
that I think like it's just like 2% that Korean,390.0,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.667,1.667,1.0,390.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
government us proof about the Visa order represent,395.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0,395.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
us but we just still have don't know or just not being currently like,400.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0,400.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
it's not clear about your Equity say that also is like if they,405.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.333,1.0,405.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0

how should they do and how should they can practice,425.0,3.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,425.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
your daily with Lexa T is like it's not it's not if they're not clear for an hour so,430.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,430.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
it's like I think they just want to know,435.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,435.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
about the things that can guarantee their life this is what I want,440.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,440.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
to say so if it's for my opinion are go men,445.0,3.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,445.0,2.667,3.333,1.667,1.0,2.333,1.0
can explain in this question and I think like all Korean maybe,450.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,450.0,3.333,3.667,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
raise the question I think it will be good things,455.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,455.0,3.0,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
it's like now it's not but in the future is maybe can,460.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,460.0,3.333,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
yeah you mean that how to guarantee the yeah,465.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,465.0,3.333,3.667,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
is like is the big question for our Korean,470.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,470.0,3.333,3.667,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
actually the refugee you mean that how to garden theater yeah the big question or Korean actually rigidity under the laws of the Korean,475.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,475.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
yeah I think if they do something wrong or cause some clams,480.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,480.0,3.0,4.0,2.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
so they will give penalty or punishment from the law as well so in this case,485.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,485.0,3.0,4.0,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
I think is not only for a little edgy for everyone that you have,490.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,490.0,4.0,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
and I'm too and you mean I think that race question because the some Koreans,495.0,3.667,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,495.0,4.0,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0

I think there's some kind of more emotional than rational equations,505.0,3.667,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,505.0,4.0,3.667,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
yeah because they are have some fear of you insecure that they are,510.0,3.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,510.0,4.0,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
happier that never seen something like that paid more than others,515.0,3.333,3.333,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,515.0,4.0,3.667,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.0

as you start that it'll be hard to hard to,425.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,425.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
be familiar with Korean portrayal as edges that that is,430.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,430.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0

I heard that almost every foreigners cannot speak,445.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,445.0,2.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
Korean even they plan to plan to,450.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,450.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
work and make some money in Korea so it's cool thing to the other foreigners not,455.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0,455.0,2.667,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
just worried cancer I think,460.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0,460.0,2.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
although I think we are a single problem,465.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,465.0,2.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
relation and we are not mature enough to take Islamic refugees,470.0,3.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,470.0,2.667,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
and most of the good work places,475.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,475.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
they will refuse to employ,480.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,480.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
Yemen refugees and they will be exposed to,485.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,485.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
crime in the end like because they cannot earn money from,490.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,490.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
good jobs and I think,495.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0,495.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
they are potential some of them are potential terrorists,500.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,500.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
and even though not all of them I know that not all of them are,505.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,505.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
potential terrorists but if there is only one people one person,510.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,510.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
want to wants to commit crime in Korea,515.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,515.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
and that will be a huge problem and at that time,520.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0,520.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
I think there is no one who can be responsible for the point so we cannot,525.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,525.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
wait for someone to commit crime and we have to prevent,530.0,2.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,530.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
that before finish the debate,535.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,535.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
and we'll start now so it isn't their,5.0,3.0,3.333,2.333,1.333,1.667,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.333,2.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
"third 338,000 Koreans now aged 25",10.0,3.0,3.333,2.333,1.333,1.667,1.0,10.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
to 34 is now unemployed so I think that the,15.0,3.333,3.0,2.333,1.333,1.667,1.0,15.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
increased number of refugees that came to Korea will,20.0,3.333,3.0,2.333,1.667,1.667,1.0,20.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
will affect more the unemployment of Koreans then it is now,25.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.667,1.667,1.0,25.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
so it is already hard for Koreans to find jobs but now the refugee,30.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.667,1.667,1.0,30.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.333,2.0,1.333
will make the employment of work harder,35.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.667,1.667,1.0,35.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.333,2.0,1.333
but,40.0,3.333,3.333,2.667,1.333,2.0,1.0,40.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.333,2.0,1.333
in my opinion,45.0,3.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,2.333,1.0,45.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.333,2.333,1.333

and there also and I think it's their responsibility,55.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,55.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.667,1.667,1.667

what the I think they,65.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,65.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.667,1.667,1.667
can do like rather than work,70.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,70.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.667,1.667,1.667
or office jobs they can relax labor employment,75.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.667,1.0,75.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.667,1.667,1.667
so,80.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,80.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.667,1.667,1.667
yeah so I think yeah so I think it's fine,85.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,85.0,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.667,1.667,1.667
but,90.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,90.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.667,1.667,1.667

think they can reconsider their decision,100.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,100.0,3.333,3.0,2.0,1.333,1.667,1.0
because nowadays because of the war the infinite,105.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.333,1.0,105.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,1.667,1.0

Island for the I saw Asylum so I think the government,120.0,3.333,3.0,2.333,1.333,2.333,1.0,120.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,2.0,1.0

think about the Korean first I think,130.0,3.333,3.0,2.333,1.333,2.333,1.0,130.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,2.0,1.0
so that the they can make the country more,135.0,3.333,3.0,2.333,1.333,2.333,1.0,135.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,2.0,1.0
wow,140.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.333,2.333,1.0,140.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,2.0,1.0
in your area of the table,145.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.333,2.333,1.0,145.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,2.0,1.0

it's not good for Korea I'm like that,285.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.333,1.667,1.0,285.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,2.0,1.0
International outside of their country,290.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.333,1.667,1.0,290.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,2.0,1.0
like you say that there are already many foreigners,295.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.333,1.667,1.0,295.0,3.333,3.0,2.333,1.333,2.0,1.0
that the already live here in Korea it's still a little but it increased,300.0,2.667,3.0,2.0,1.333,1.667,1.0,300.0,3.333,3.0,2.333,1.333,2.0,1.0
little by little hey and now it with the number of refugees,305.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.333,1.667,1.0,305.0,3.333,2.667,2.333,2.0,1.667,1.667
I think they're already a lot of foreigners and Koreans I think it's normal,310.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.333,1.667,1.0,310.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,2.0,1.667,1.667
for for the people to protect their culture so that they don't mix with,315.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,1.667,1.0,315.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,2.0,1.667,1.667
another Foreigner culture,320.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,1.667,1.0,320.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,2.0,1.667,1.667
right so you don't want to,325.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,1.667,1.0,325.0,3.333,3.333,2.333,1.333,1.333,1.667
it is normal for two people to like protect first to protect your culture and then also,330.0,3.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.667,1.0,330.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,1.333,1.667
I think they argue also about the safety,335.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.667,1.667,1.0,335.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,1.333,1.667
of the Korean citizens like there's a killing,340.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.667,1.667,1.0,340.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.333,1.333,1.667
or right only Korean woman speaking of safety,345.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.667,1.667,1.0,345.0,3.333,3.0,2.333,1.333,1.333,1.667
it doesn't it doesn't guarantee that if this country only consists of,350.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.667,1.667,1.0,350.0,3.0,2.667,2.0,1.667,1.667,2.0
real all these Koreans it very the safety,355.0,3.333,3.0,2.333,1.667,1.667,1.0,355.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.667,1.667,2.0
because as you know there's a there are some cases like,360.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.667,1.667,1.0,360.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.667,1.667,2.0
women being raped at Night by a little like the case in the how,365.0,3.667,3.667,3.0,1.667,1.667,1.0,365.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.0
I think I heard the news about the and like people a woman being killed in real number is some,370.0,3.667,3.667,2.667,1.667,1.667,1.0,370.0,4.0,4.0,3.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
some man and then also the reason issue,375.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.667,1.667,1.0,375.0,3.667,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
about the you know the spy cam in the exact way so it doesn't,380.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.667,1.667,1.0,380.0,3.0,3.333,2.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
even if it doesn't guarantee that this the,385.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.667,2.0,1.667,385.0,2.667,2.667,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.667
Koreans also I mean just even just if there's only the screen and then,390.0,3.0,3.0,2.333,1.667,2.0,1.667,390.0,2.667,2.667,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.667
doesn't guarantee safety so I think it's you can just,395.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.667,2.0,1.667,395.0,2.667,2.333,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.667

be like a terrorist or or like being terrorists or criminals I think we yeah I don't think it's,405.0,3.0,3.0,2.667,1.667,2.333,1.667,405.0,2.667,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.333,2.0
right to just judge someone just because we different,410.0,2.667,3.333,2.667,1.667,2.333,1.667,410.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.667,1.333,2.0

the keep increasing until now and also I think it will,435.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.667,2.333,1.667,435.0,2.667,3.0,2.667,1.667,1.333,2.0
be more game in the next year 2020,440.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.667,2.333,1.667,440.0,2.667,2.667,2.667,1.667,1.333,2.0

that population will we will be,460.0,3.333,3.0,2.333,1.667,2.333,1.667,460.0,3.333,3.333,2.667,1.667,1.333,1.667

the inverse number will will significantly,485.0,3.333,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.333,485.0,3.667,3.667,2.667,1.0,1.333,1.0

read that in one of the Articles here that the Korea actually,500.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.333,500.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0

I really I read that whatever yeah it's,520.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.333,520.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
fine why so because,525.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.333,525.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
like they also deal to provide some settlement like how to do,530.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.333,530.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
North Korean defectors like to how to settle in Korea,535.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.333,535.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
and like like they're putting deafening living in Korea and,540.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.333,540.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
I wonder why can they just I mean they they know how to end they they have,545.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.333,545.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
they may I have the money for it but why can't they do the same for your,550.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.333,2.0,1.333,550.0,2.667,3.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
okay the first are maybe you cannot understand,5.0,3.333,4.0,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,5.0,3.667,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
my sentence or statement because and maybe it myself,10.0,3.333,3.667,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,10.0,3.667,3.333,2.0,1.0,1.667,1.0
I'm not very good at English and I'm the president so,15.0,3.667,3.667,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,15.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
if we can understand that ask me yes I,20.0,3.667,3.667,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,20.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0
agree with the issue of Germany's Refugee acceptance,25.0,3.667,3.667,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,25.0,3.333,3.0,1.667,1.333,1.667,1.0
with main three regions the fir first,30.0,3.667,3.667,2.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,30.0,2.667,3.0,1.667,1.333,1.667,1.0
I think there's no reason why we have to,35.0,3.333,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,35.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
designate specific country people why Yemen is how about others,40.0,4.0,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,40.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
or Chinese or Japanese or other East Asian Europeans,45.0,4.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,45.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
Americans so I think there's no proper reason,50.0,4.0,4.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,50.0,3.333,2.667,1.333,1.333,1.667,1.0
in that issue and second although public opinion is also important,55.0,4.0,4.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,55.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
but Yemen is Refugee Heaven,60.0,4.0,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,60.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
cause critical issues before you in Korea in myself,65.0,4.333,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,65.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
yeah and finally from a legal point of view Korea,70.0,4.333,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0,70.0,2.333,3.333,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
is not traditional and classic our nation our nation in Korean,75.0,4.333,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,75.0,2.333,3.333,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
I mean joke our country defined in the constitution,80.0,4.333,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,80.0,2.333,3.333,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
is a multicultural country if we prohibit,85.0,4.0,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,85.0,2.333,3.333,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
them then it is against the Constitution,90.0,4.333,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,90.0,2.667,3.333,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
Constitution against humble yes so,95.0,4.333,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,95.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
because of these reasons I agree with,100.0,4.0,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,100.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
Refugee acceptance,105.0,4.0,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,105.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
first,110.0,4.0,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,110.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
one thing that I,115.0,4.0,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,115.0,2.667,2.667,1.333,1.667,1.333,1.0
couldn't really understand this referring to Chinese and Japanese so like,120.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,120.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
the definition of refugees or,125.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,125.0,4.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,2.333,1.0
refuges are supposed to be refugees because they have certain problems,130.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,130.0,4.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
in their countries that were or religious problems but then in,135.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,135.0,4.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
Japan there are some problems in China and,140.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,140.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
those people can like apply for being Korean refugees,145.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,145.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
but I don't know about any water or religious problems,150.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,150.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
in Japan so and many other like European countries it's mostly the middle,155.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,155.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
is two countries that have were and Refugee problem,160.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,160.0,4.333,2.333,1.333,1.333,2.333,1.333
so there,165.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,165.0,4.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
one of the main reason that I disagree with accepting refugees is that,170.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,170.0,4.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
the problem in Yemen and many other countries that like Syria,175.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,175.0,4.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0
it's mostly the problem of religion and,180.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,180.0,3.667,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
so this religious problem is due to Islam and like Islam has mainly two,185.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,185.0,3.667,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
groups sunnis and Shiites as far as I remember and these two groups are,190.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,190.0,4.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
fighting each other but then the Saudi Saudi Arabia and,195.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,195.0,4.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
many other middle is confused horribly who have National,200.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,200.0,4.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
religion of Islam or not accepting refugees when they are the main,205.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,205.0,4.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
cause of the so I don't think like,210.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,210.0,4.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
it when Islam's or lot of sex with instruments,215.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,215.0,4.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
today some Christians in Greek,220.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,220.0,4.333,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
can you I don't understand the meaning of religious,225.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,225.0,4.0,3.333,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0
okay and first u.s.,230.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,230.0,4.0,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
mentioned that refugees the definition of refugees,235.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,235.0,4.333,2.667,1.667,1.0,1.667,1.0
not obvious right,240.0,3.667,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,240.0,4.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
in myself in Constitution,245.0,3.667,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,245.0,3.667,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
there is no different there's no evidence why we,250.0,3.667,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,250.0,2.667,2.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.667
differentiate,255.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,255.0,2.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.333
people are between Refugee and others so,260.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,260.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
I think Refugee Yemen is Refugee should be there,265.0,3.667,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,265.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
with compared with same,270.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,270.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
have yeah I mean yeah,275.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,275.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
there,280.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,280.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
is,285.0,3.667,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,285.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
like so the first reason why disagree with accepting refugees,290.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,290.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
as because of like many other Islamic countries are not accepting refugees,295.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,295.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
and the second reason is that like Islam is although it's,300.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,300.0,2.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
getting a bit better Islam is still a very sexist religion,305.0,3.333,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,305.0,2.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
and and Islam woman is treated like,310.0,3.0,3.667,1.333,1.0,1.667,1.0,310.0,2.333,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
a property of man I think but when a man is speed refuges,315.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,315.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
come to Korea they still holds that idea in their mind and,320.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.333,1.0,320.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
so before but then Korea accepted them before going through like,325.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,325.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
lecture like before educating them about why,330.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,330.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.333
like man and woman should be treated equally and so with,335.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,335.0,3.667,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.333
that idea might that woman is a property of matter I,340.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,340.0,4.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
believe that many yemenis people who might cause of problems in Korea,345.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,345.0,4.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
in Jeju Island and yeah,350.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,350.0,4.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
I guess your prediction right that's TRUE,355.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,355.0,4.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
so I mention that,360.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,360.0,4.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
state that issues in second reason,365.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,365.0,4.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
and like my second reason was there's no reason why we the second reason and like my second reason was there's no reason why we,370.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,370.0,4.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
treat sorry the,375.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,375.0,4.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
yemenis refugees haven't caused critical research paper so the prediction is,380.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,380.0,4.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
that relation are in myself,385.0,3.333,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,385.0,4.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
Isla,390.0,3.333,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,390.0,4.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
countries yeah but Islam countries,395.0,3.333,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,395.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0
and in myself in my opinion it's one countries and Korea is different,400.0,3.333,4.0,2.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,400.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,2.0,1.0
or different because,405.0,3.333,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,405.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
eligius regions regions are Korea in Korea prepare have three right,410.0,3.667,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,410.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
to choose any religion but in Islam countries,415.0,3.333,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,415.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
they do they can't and other,420.0,3.333,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,420.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
primary bigger point of view there's,425.0,3.667,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,425.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
very very different laws in each country yes,430.0,3.667,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,430.0,3.0,3.333,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
so their country their cultures are different they're such thinking is different,435.0,3.333,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,435.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
so that reason is the proper in myself,440.0,3.333,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,440.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
I agree with your idea that,445.0,3.333,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,445.0,3.0,2.667,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
like if there are refugees coming over to Korea because they,450.0,3.333,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,450.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
were,455.0,3.333,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,455.0,3.0,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
I,460.0,3.333,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,460.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
think,465.0,3.333,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,465.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
that,470.0,3.333,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,470.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
if they are treated unfairly in religion then they should,475.0,3.333,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,475.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
be accepted as Koreans I mean they should be accepted in refugees as refugees in Korea,480.0,3.333,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.0,1.0,480.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
but then these yemenis people or not that case like they do to Korea,485.0,3.333,3.667,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,485.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
because of the war but then the problem is that the world was created like door was,490.0,3.667,4.0,1.667,1.0,1.333,1.0,490.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
closed by the Islam's fighting over but then Korea is not an Islamic country so,495.0,3.667,4.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,495.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0
I believe,500.0,3.333,4.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,500.0,2.667,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
like most have what's the,505.0,3.333,4.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,505.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
most have some responsibilities,510.0,3.333,4.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,510.0,3.333,3.333,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
of these refugees but then they're not taking any responsibility so like why does,515.0,3.333,4.0,1.333,1.0,1.333,1.0,515.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
Korea have to take the responsibility like most high most have some responsibility of these refugees but then they're not taking any responsibility so like why does Korea have to take the responsibility okay,520.0,3.333,4.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,520.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
work,525.0,3.333,4.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,525.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
yeah in some point I agree with your opinion,530.0,3.333,4.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,530.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
and your statement is real good,535.0,3.333,4.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,535.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
good in myself but from in,540.0,3.333,4.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,540.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0

very critical or significant issues about this,550.0,3.333,4.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,550.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
in do respect because if you can't then,555.0,3.333,4.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,555.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
The Courier what curse income,560.0,3.333,4.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,560.0,3.333,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
cannot there with this issue and cannot,565.0,3.333,4.0,1.333,1.0,1.0,1.0,565.0,3.667,3.0,1.333,1.333,1.333,1.0
