572,572,current people such as this idea of youth unemployment yeah,50,2,1,0,0,0,0,50,2,0,0,0,0,0,-1.246,-1.146,-1.429,-1.308,0.102,-0.27,-0.265,-1.242,-1.533,-1.396,-1.503,-1.257,-0.659,-0.658,-3.022,-1.967,1
573,573,and also the second point is that because of the mass in flux,55,0,1,0,0,0,0,55,2,0,0,0,0,0,0.566,0.507,-0.585,-0.794,4.341,3.344,2.723,-0.166,-1.327,-1.323,-1.271,-1.223,-0.458,-0.437,-1.69,-1.517,1
